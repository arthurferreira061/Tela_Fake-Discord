Some of these rules should be based on Discord’s community guidelines and terms of service, while others are more related to general internet etiquette or even your server’s specific needs. Once you determine the general principles under which your server will operate, you will need to determine how much detail you want to provide in your rules and how to enforce them.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord Community Guidelines and Terms of Service</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To summarize, the guidelines govern user behavior on Discord and outline what is and isn’t acceptable in all communities.

Your server rules play an important part, not just in determining how your mod team will react to users, but also how your users will interact with each other, and ultimately your server culture. Therefore, your rules should strive to create a fun and welcoming environment for people of all races, genders, and sexualities while balancing community needs with the need for order. In additions to the rules and guidelines set forth by Discord, you may want to consider prohibiting the following behaviors:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Trolling </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">- Trolling refers to the act of disrupting the chat, making a nuisance out of yourself, deliberately making others uncomfortable, or otherwise attempting to start trouble.</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This is a good catch-all rule to have because it enables you to take action on those that are “acting out” without doing anything really specific to call them out on.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Discussing Offensive/Controversial Material</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - This includes topics such as politics, religion, acts of violence, rape, suicide/self harm, school shootings, and other serious topics; as well as hate speech including racial slurs or derivatives thereof, sexist or homophobic statements, and other similar types of behavior.</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The details of how you define this rule can vary depending on the extent to which you feel it is necessary to enforce (for example, if you are following the partner code of conduct you may want to also include “ableist slurs” as being prohibited.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Elitism </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">- Members should refrain from insulting or belittling others based on the games or versions of games that they choose to play.</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This is especially applicable to Discord servers where one game may be distributed among multiple regions from a gameplay or version perspective</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Disrespecting Server Staff - </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Insulting the server moderators or becoming belligerent after being warned.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While measured discussion regarding the reasons for being warned should be encouraged for the education of the user and general public, at some point it may be necessary to shut down the discussion or take it to DMs. </span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Incitement </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">- Encouraging the breaking of rules, inciting others to be blatantly rude and offensive, or otherwise promoting and/or encouraging conflicts between other members.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Punishment Evasion</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Users should not attempt to evade the consequences of their actions such as using an alternate account to bypass restrictions.</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is recommended that this be punishable with an instant ban, as this is the type of punishment that is most difficult to evade compared to the other options available.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A user that is evading a ban is generally considered by Discord’s Trust and Safety team to be harassment, and can be reported to them for further action.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Inappropriate User Profiles</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - For ease of communication and the comfort of those in chat, the profile picture, custom status, and display names (i.e., the name that shows up while reading the chat) of users should be in line with the rules of the server. Furthermore, the display name should also be easily readable, mentionable, and not attempt to imitate other users or game development staff or hoist you to the top of the server online list</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In effect, this also means that the user profile should be safe for work, not contain any offensive or illegal content, and not be used to harass others or spam/scam.</span></li>\\n<li><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">“Hoisting” refers to using characters like exclamation points to make it so that you appear at the top of the online members list. Some people will put multiple characters like this in an attempt to be at the top of the online list. While it is not always feasible to enforce against users that don’t often chat, it is good to have a policy to enforce this if you see someone chatting with a hoisted display name. But, if this doesn’t bother you, you can remove this provision.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Advertisement</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Similar but not quite the same as spam, this refers to users attempting to promote their own social media/discord servers/other content creation channels.</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Usually, it is good to invite users to talk to a moderator privately if they want to advertise something.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Speaking languages not understood by the server</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Essentially, users should be prohibited from communicating in a language outside of the server’s official language.</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This makes it easier for moderators to moderate the server by ensuring that they understand the conversations that are happening and prevents users from trying to fly under the radar by speaking in languages moderators don’t understand.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Server Specific Considerations</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Your server will also have needs of its own not covered in the previous two sections, and that’s ok! It is perfectly normal to set up channel-specific rules or to even override certain server rules in certain channels. Some examples include:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An artist channel where artists are allowed to advertise their art creation profiles (e.g., Pixiv, DeviantArt).</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An image spam channel where people can flood the channel with images.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A “current events” channel where people can discuss some controversial topics in a civil fashion.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An “on topic” chat where people should specifically only talk about a certain thing, compared to an “off topic” chat where general conversation about anything is allowed.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A game-related friend request channel or “carry” where users that post there should be expected to be pinged frequently for assistance in a way that is not considered harassment/spam.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You will need to carefully consider your server’s specific needs when coming up with channel rules or other server-wide rules.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Rule Enforcement</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Establishing your rules is all well and good, but ultimately a moot point if you don’t enforce them. Moderators should carefully consider how they want to enforce their server rules. Some possible systems include:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Case by Case</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Punishment is more subjective and dependent on the nature and frequency of transgressions. While this system gives moderators a large amount of flexibility, accountability can be difficult due to the lack of standards and certain moderators may punish users differently. This may be better suited to smaller servers where the moderation tasks tend to be leaner.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Infraction Based</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Similar to a “three strikes and you’re out” system, users are punished according to the number of times they break the rules. Users may receive a mute after a certain number of warnings followed by a ban. While this system is great for accountability, it does not account for the severity of the transgressions involved.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Points based</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - If you’d like the accountability of the strikes/infraction based system coupled with the flexibility of the case by case system, consider a points based rule enforcement structure. In this system, each rule is worth a certain number of points based on the importance and severity of breaking the rule where moderators can adjust the point value with an additional explanation for accountability.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Appeals</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If a user thinks their warning is unfair, they may lash out in chat or in the feedback channels of the server. It is important to have a way users can easily discuss their warning with the server moderators. You can visit a more in-depth explanation on appeals in </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060483733\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">DMA 204: Ban Appeals</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Bringing It All Together</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">From creating your rules to developing a discipline system, you should now have a set of rules that incorporate the important Discord-wide rules, rules that make your server a welcoming place, and rules specific to your server to help things run smoothly. By enforcing these rules clearly and consistently with an accountable tracking system and transparent appeal process, you should be well on your way to a server you can be proud of!</span></p>"')

Because of this </span><strong>granting this role to any user or bot should be done with the utmost caution and on an as-needed basis.</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Because bots can automate actions on Discord, bots with this permission can instantly delete all of your text channels, remove your emotes and roles, create hundreds of roles with the Administrator permission and start assigning them to your other users, and otherwise cause unmitigated havoc on your server faster than you can even understand what is happening. While the chance of this happening with larger or more renowned public bots is low, you should be mindful that this is the sort of power you are giving to a Discord Bot if you grant it the Administrator permission and only do so if you are confident the bot </span><strong>and its development team</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> can be trusted.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Before giving this permission to a user, consider if giving them a role that has every other permission enabled will serve your purpose. This way you can at least protect your channels via channel permissions. You may also find on further consideration that the user in question does not even need every permission, and will be fine with only a couple of elevated permissions. If  you do give Administrator to anyone, it is highly recommended to enable 2FA for your server as described in the next section.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Administrative Role Permissions</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord has several role-specific permissions that grant what would be considered “administrative functionality” to users (not to be confused with the actual Administrator permission). These permissions are considered sensitive enough that if you are in a server where two-factor authentication (2FA) is required for moderators, these permissions are disabled. You can read more about what 2FA is and how to enable it on your account </span><a href=\\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">here</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.

However, there is no Discord permission that allows you to “mute” a user in such a fashion.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Instead, what happens is that a Discord bot creates a “mute role” and then for every channel in the server sets the channel permissions for that role such that users with that role are not allowed to send messages or add reactions. When you mute a user through the bot, it assigns them that role and thus prevents them from interacting in the server’s channels.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is also possible to set this up yourself and then manually assign the mute role to users that need to be muted from chatting.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderation Bots</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A lot of moderation on Discord is done using bots. You can find plenty of them by doing some research online. Some options include MEE6, CarlBot, Zeppelin, Dyno, GiselleBot, Gaius, and more. You can learn about some of these bots and what auto-moderation looks like <a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000178701\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">here</a>. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Inviting Bots</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To invite a bot to a server, you must have either </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Administrator</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> or </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Manage Server</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> permission</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The goal of this article is to familiarize you with Discord permissions and moderation actions so that you can more effectively moderate or manage your own server.

},2360:function(e){
e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the most difficult aspects of being a Discord server moderator can be finding new people to help you moderate your community. You need to find individuals that match in personality, mindset, knowledge, availability, and most importantly, trust. While much of this differs between servers and teams, I hope to cover the most important parts as well as giving you an idea of what the common questions are and what to watch out for. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Do You Need More Moderators?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The first thing to ask yourself or your moderator team before bringing in another team member is whether you actually need additional help. For example, a server that provides technical support or assists members in a more personal fashion may require more moderators than a community server for a mobile game even if the number of members is the same. An additional and important factor to consider is moderator burnout. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Placing too many responsibilities on too few moderators can quickly cause members of the team to lose interest and feel like they do not have enough time to commit to moderation. In some cases, it can actually be beneficial to have too many mods rather than too few, but it is important to remember there is no perfect number of moderators to have on your server.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The most important thing to keep in mind when recruiting moderators is the purpose moderators have in your server and the extent to which those duties are (or aren’t) currently being fulfilled. For instance:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Are there time periods in your server where moderators are unavailable to answer questions or resolve incidents?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Are user reports of bad behavior going unactioned for too long?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Is it unfeasible to implement additional automoderator measures to reduce the number of incidents?</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You may also have specific duties that you require of your moderators beyond typical server moderation. Be sure to analyze these as well and determine if there is any shortfall between what your mod team needs to do and what it is currently able to do.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An example of what this situation might look like is if your moderators might also be the ones handling technical support requests, or contributing to another site. If you need people for a specific task it might make sense to create a separate role for those people. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Selection Process</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you decide that you </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">do </span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">need to select new mods an important part of recruiting new mods is having a well-defined selection process. Here are a few things that you should consider when establishing this process:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How are candidates selected? Either recruitment or mod applications</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How do you vet people that might not be a good fit?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How is the current moderation team involved in this decision?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What permissions you want to give out to newer staff?</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Candidate selection</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Selection is a highly subjective topic; some servers accept new members via a vote, some have rules where the decision has to be unanimous, and others are more open. In all cases, it’s important to consider that the person is someone you and your team would be comfortable working with.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are 3 main ways a candidate might be brought to the mod team for acceptance that can be mixed and matched, but it’s usually recommended to only have 1 official method:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The most common method in smaller servers is the owner selecting new mods. This works in the earlier stages, but as the server grows in number of staff it may discourage healthy discussion about that person that may be relevant (like behavior in other communities that might show who that person really is or things that might hurt the reputation of the mod team as a whole). </span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The second most common is having an application form. While this is effective in obtaining the information that you are looking for, it might attract people that just want to be a moderator for the power or status. It will also change their behavior in the main chat as they know they have eyes on them, which might make it harder for the mod team to evaluate how truthful the responses to the form were.</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The main advantage of this is that it would let you modify the form to find a person for a specific purpose and might include an optional follow-up interview. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Be careful about “application floods” and have methods to filter low-quality applications out (like captchas, questions about your server where if you get it wrong it gets automatically rejected, random questions to prevent bots, or small tests like type your timezone in a specific format). You can also provide a basic test of competence, if they can’t manage the simple elements of the form, they won\'t manage as mod.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Finally, you can have the members of your current moderation team recommend users as candidates. As the user is not aware that they are being assessed for staff, it means that their behavior in chat is unchanged from their typical behavior. With time and observation, this allows you to find the answers to the questions that would have been on your form along with extra red or green flags. It also allows you to find people that would never apply for staff in a form due to reluctance or lack of confidence, but that would be a great fit for your moderation team.</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The drawbacks to this process is that it tends to introduce more work in the vetting process, as it’s not as linear as an application form. Additionally, it might result in a more limited scope of candidates.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Vetting</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An important consideration when selecting moderators is determining if the candidate is able to do their job effectively. A lot of server owners pick their own friends to mod their servers, which might result in personality clashes, unproductive discussions about rules, or inactive mods that can’t meaningfully contribute to discussions.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A good question to ask yourself is: “Do I trust this person?” </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, you might not want to suggest anyone that has not been actively helping for at least a year. During that year you can come to know the person, and it can help you determine if they are more interested in the good of the community as a whole and not just a role. You are looking for experience and willingness to improve the community.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">External research can also be beneficial, such as a quick Google search that could show other communities this person might be involved with or asking for their experience on the application form. If you find them in moderation roles in other communities, perhaps it may be worth speaking to the leadership of other communities the user is involved in to get their opinion on that potential moderator’s work ethic and general attitude.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Ascertaining someone’s motive for becoming a moderator is another thing to consider. Think about why they want to be involved in your community in this way, what is motivating them. Some points to think about include:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Are they just trying to get more status? </span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Do they have new ideas or contacts, but don’t necessarily need to be part of the staff team?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Do they have a history of problems with specific users that might bias their decision making? Is that a deal breaker or do they seem capable of deferring those connections to other moderators who are uninvolved? </span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Be mindful that asking the user for their motives directly or giving any hints about potential promotions might change their behavior. Instead focus on looking for clues on how they interact with the rest of the community in order to determine their reasons.<br><br>That being said, here are some things to keep in mind when deciding to vet a potential mod. While vetting users in this manner may be a better fit for larger communities, it\'s maybe less applicable to smaller, more intimate servers. It\'s worth noting this is an example and that the vetting process differs depending upon the size of the server and the servers\' needs, but regardless of server size candidates should show a dedicated and long-term invested interest and desire to help in the community. <br></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After you’ve made your selections and you (and your mod team!) are comfortable with having them join the team, it’s time to consider how to onboard them.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Onboarding</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the most important parts of bringing new people is the onboarding process. A well thought out process can make people effective faster, with minimal misunderstandings and mistakes from the onset. Utilizing the techniques and implementing the tips in </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000178021\\" target=\\"_self\\">302: Developing Moderator Guidelines</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> can help you create a guideline for your moderation team that makes onboarding easier for all parties involved. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The efforts put into the early stages of moderator management pay off in multitudes down the line. Having a deliberate and carefully thought out process for selecting your mods ensures that your moderation team grows in a stable and effective way with your server. The foundation of any good community is a well moderated community, and the foundation for a well moderated community lies in having great moderators. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>"')

Public Discords</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> will have a large number of unknown users joining the server from potentially anywhere depending on how the invite link is distributed, especially if you have a </span><a href=\\"https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001542132-Server-Vanity-URLs\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">vanity URL</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, and so implementing verification is important. While it is possible that a verification gate will not be necessary if the topic of the server is relatively unknown, for the sake of future-proofing your server it is still highly recommended.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Otherwise, you can also consider the following criteria to determine if you want to implement a verification gate or not.</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Have you received reports from members of receiving spam or scam direct messages from users in your server? Do you anticipate this may be an issue after your server is opened?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Have you had difficulty dealing with server raids, such as groups of new users spamming inappropriate images or words in your general chat channels, or do you anticipate this might be an issue based on the way you are advertising your server?</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If the answer to those questions is yes, you may want to consider implementing a verification gate. However, even if the answer to these questions is no, you should still consider at least setting your </span><a href=\\"https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/216679607-What-are-Verification-Levels-\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">server verification level</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> to Medium, as this will help deter raiders using brand new accounts to spam your server or its members DMs. If you do not need a verification gate, this choice is ultimately up to you. If you do want a verification gate, the choice of server verification level will be explained in the recommendation section.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Special Verification: Member Interview</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This article generally focuses on automated methods of verification such as those that can be accomplished with a Discord bot, due to the reduction in human overhead and the increase in verification speed that comes from using a bot. However, if your server is about a sensitive topic or involves users sharing personal information, you may want to consider having moderators personally interview new members or ask them to write an introduction and then reviewing their answers before granting them access to the server. Because this process is very labor-intensive, the writing of the interview questions, the evaluation of the responses, and the implementation of the interview process may vary widely from server to server. You should carefully consider your server needs and resources before choosing this method of verification.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some things to consider include:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How can I assess the personality of new users?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How can I learn about their history of conduct?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Why does this user want to join the server?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How can I have a user prove their good intentions in joining?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Are there any tools I can use to make the approval process easier?</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If a user passes their interview, you can either assign them a “verified” role or remove the “unverified” role. The differences between implementing these roles is discussed later.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Other types of verification gates</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Roughly speaking, verification gates require users joining your server to take a specific action (either in a direct message, or in a specific channel in the server) before they are granted access to the rest of the server.</span></p>\\n<h4>Channel-Based Verification</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This form of verification involves sending the verification instructions and receiving the user response on the server itself. These gates can use one channel for both the verification instructions and user response, or they can require two channels.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In the two-channel system, one channel is used to perform the verification action (in which read message history is off), while the other simply contains instructions on the verification process (where read message history is enabled). In either case, a bot is generally used to process the user’s message and verify them (for example, a user could type </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">!verify</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> to verify themselves).</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When using only a single channel, the channel description may contain the instructions, or a bot message is sent when a user joins the server that has the instructions. If using the channel description for instructions, you can avoid needing to keep read message history on. However, people may not be aware that they need to read the channel description for instructions.</span></p>\\n<h4>Reaction-Based Verification</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For reaction-based verification, the user reading the contents of a channel and clicks on a reaction in order to complete the verification process. This is usually implemented as an extra set of instructions at the bottom of a server rules channel with a single reaction on the message for users to click.</span></p>\\n<h4>DM-Based Verification</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Users may also receive a DM as soon as they join the server, almost always sent by a bot. The verification process is then completed in the direct messages with that bot. If using DM based verification, it is also useful to have a backup channel for people to manually initiate the DM verification if they weren’t able to receive direct messages when joining the server due to their privacy settings or Discord issues.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In any case, after unverified members perform the required action, a Discord bot can grant them access to the rest of the server, either by removing a role that is hiding the rest of the channels, or granting a role that provides access to the rest of the channels.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Add Role vs. Remove Role Verification Gates</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The first thing you need to figure out is whether you want to verify users by giving them an “Unverified” role upon joining the server and removing it after they verify, or to give them no roles upon joining the server and give them a “Verified” role after completing verification. A comparison of the differences between the two methods as applied to the verification methods above is shown below. Please note that this comparison does not account for verification methods not discussed in this article.</span></p>\\n<table border=\\"1px\\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p><strong>Characteristic</strong></p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p><strong>Add Verified Role</strong></p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p><strong>Remove Unverified Role</strong></p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p><strong>Bypassing the server verification level</strong></p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Users will be subject to the server verification level until they verify.</span></p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Users will not be subject to the server verification level on joining, but will be after they verify.</span></p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p><strong>Role Permissions</strong></p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The @everyone role should have no permissions, the Verified role should have the permissions you would normally give to @everyone.</span></p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The @everyone role should have normal permissions.

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An often neglected part of administering a Discord server is the onboarding process for your moderators. Even when people have the right mindset, knowledge, and availability to moderate your server, there will still be an adjustment period. Your new moderators need to learn not just the technical ins and outs of your server moderation system, but they also need to adapt to more subjective expectations. These expectations include how to conduct themselves on the server, when and how to warn users, and other server-specific considerations and clarifications. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While much of this will be subjective and something for you to determine yourself, this will cover some important moderation principles that you can use when developing your own moderator guidelines. An example set of moderation guidelines will be included at the end of this article.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Lead by Example</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The moderators are the people that your community members look to, not just for enforcement of server rules and maintaining the peace, but also as role models for what behavior is appropriate for the server. If your users see moderators ignoring or bending certain rules, they will learn that that is ok for them to do so also, and they will call you out if you attempt to hypocritically enforce rules against them. As such, moderators should hold themselves to a higher standard than other users, especially in regards to civility and more subjective rules such as what is considered NSFW content. This also applies also for private interactions among the mod team.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, if a moderator is talking in chat and shares a suggestive picture, users will understand that other pictures that are equally as suggestive are ok to post. Not only will this encourage borderline rule-breaking behavior, it makes it more difficult for moderators to peacefully moderate NSFW content because users will say “Well, you posted this picture and the picture I posted is basically the same.” The same holds true in the way moderators respond to questions. If someone asks for help on something and moderators respond to them rudely or condescendingly others will treat new users the same way and create a hostile environment.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">That’s not to say that moderators can’t have fun, of course. Moderators can and should participate in chat regularly and engage with members as normal users. If a moderator entering chat is disruptive in and of itself, it usually means that moderators are not active enough in the server. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Ultimately, moderators should strive to be seen fondly by server members, yet respected in their positions of authority. Moderators that fail to enforce rules will be seen as unprofessional or “pushovers” by the server members, while moderators that enforce rules too strictly and/or do not participate in chat will be seen as aloof, aggressive, or out of touch.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Spirit of the Rules</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the things you may often hear is that the “spirit of the rules” is more important than the “letter.” In other words, it is more important that people follow the intent of the rules, rather than adhering to a literal or technical definition. As a result, moderators should focus on managing the problems of chat, including addressing unhealthy behavior that may not directly break a rule. It is appropriate to moderate people that are </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">deliberately</span> <span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">toeing the line to see what they can get away with (i.e., trolling), but what many moderator teams also forget is that </span><strong>the rules are not infallible, and moderators should use their judgment to enforce rules only when it makes sense, and not blindly following the letter of the law</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There may be instances where the wording or specifics of the rules end up disallowing behavior that, in practice, does not go against the main principle of moderation. In these cases, moderators should refrain from warning the user without consulting the rest of their mod team and also seriously consider modifying the rules to more accurately reflect the expectations of the mod team in regards to server conduct.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example: let’s say you have a rule that prevents users from cropping images to focus on sexual body parts in order to prevent NSFW conversations from occurring in chat. However, someone ends up cropping an image of an in game character to focus on her skirt from behind, discussing the outfit. In this case, it may not be appropriate to warn the user since they are using this image to start an appropriate conversation, even if it technically breaks the rule about cropping pictures. So, the mod team should discuss ways that the rule can be rewritten to cover scenarios like these, rather than resign themselves to warning the user “because the rules say so.”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Remember: </span><strong>the rules exist to serve the community, not the other way around</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. Moderators should conduct themselves in accordance with the rules, and potentially even better, but they ultimately have the power to change them for the better of the server if need be. Treat your rules as a living document and remember that they are there to improve your community, not stunt it. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When to Forgo Progressive Discipline</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While certain rules readily offer an “instant ban” option (such as doxxing) in some cases, a user’s conduct may reveal that they are only in chat to troll or otherwise cause trouble in a way that does not break one of the instant ban rules. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Just as the rules exist to serve the community, so too does the progressive discipline system. The purpose of the progressive discipline system is to allow your members to understand their bad behavior and rectify it in the future without unduly punishing them for occasional small mistakes. Conversely, this means that users that are clearly acting in bad faith on the server may not be afforded the same leniency and should be muted or banned depending on the circumstances especially if the user in question does not have any previously normal chat history. While users that instantly break rules without message history could all be potentially banned, some behavior you may want to consider in particular includes:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Predatory comments (e.g., “Are there any girls on this server? Send me a DM.”)</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Racial slurs</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Posting “cursed” images or otherwise spamming images in the wrong channels</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Advertising other servers/their own social media</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It’s important that disruptive users be addressed quickly before they sour the mood of the other server members (which could lead to additional infractions from users that were incited by the original bad behavior in the first place). Just as moderators should not use the rules to punish users that don’t practically deserve it, moderators should also be sure not to allow disruptive users to remain on the principle of following policy.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Other Considerations</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While the principles above are the most generally important moderation principles, there may be other things you want to include in your moderator guidelines channel as well such as</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How to evaluate more subjective rules (e.g., “what is NSFW content?”)</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Technical instructions such as how to log warnings or other procedural information</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The purpose of various moderation related channels</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Always keep in mind any peculiarities of your server and questions your moderators might have so that you can proactively address them before they become issues.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A moderation guidelines channel is an important channel for helping your moderators get acquainted with both the procedural aspects of moderation and the more subjective aspects. Moderators should be aware that they are leading by example and hold themselves to a higher standard so that other users will be encouraged to follow their example. This will help them perform their duties smoothly as well as allow them to readily de-escalate conflicts before they become an issue, encouraging a positive server culture. Finally, by encouraging your moderators to evaluate situations critically, you have mods that can understand both when users should be swiftly punished as well as when rules may need to be adjusted or clarified to allow greater flexibility.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you’re interested in seeing example moderation guidelines, you can check out the link </span><a href=\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NOi6RUnfK5VTvsKplsg8bTY67s-4V5p49QqSvtDofHg/edit?usp=sharing\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">here</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.

The purpose of displaying them here is to provide context for what these terms mean for those unfamiliar with them, which will in turn allow moderators to make appropriate decisions of which content to filter in their communities and foster environments where everyone feels welcome.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Introduction</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The core foundation of a server on Discord is the community that populates it. Your community is what you engage with, protect, and grow over time. Engagement is important to focus on, but it’s just as important to make sure you are facilitating </span><strong>positive and welcoming engagement.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Why Positive Environments are Important</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Positive engagement can mean a lot of things, but in this article, we will be referring to the way in which moderation can affect the culture of the server you are moderating. As moderators your policies, knowledge of your community, and deductive skills influence the way in which your community engages with each other and with your team.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When you establish and nurture your community, you are growing a collective group of people who all enjoy at least some of the same things. Regardless of your server topic, you are undoubtedly going to have members across different a variety of ethnicities, sexual orientations, and identities from across the world. Ensuring that your space on Discord is a space for them to belong necessitates making it safe for them to feel like they can be themselves, wholly, and without reservation. Your members are all humans, all community members, all people that deserve respect and deserve to be welcomed.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Establishing Community Boundaries in Moderation</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When you are establishing your community, it’s important to have a basic understanding of what kind of environment you would like your server to be. It’s good to break down the general moderation philosophy on what content and discussion you’d like your community to engage in and what content would be inappropriate given the space. Depending on the topic of your server these goals may be different, but some common questions you can ask to establish general boundaries are:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>What is the main topic of my server?</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> When you’re thinking about the community and their impact on the growth of your server, it’s important to deduce what kind of server you want to build on a base conceptual level. If, for example, you are creating a politically-driven server, you might have different limits and expectations content and conversation wise for your community than a server based on Tetris or pets.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>What topics do I expect users to engage in?</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Some servers will have the expectation that members will be allowed to discuss more sensitive or controversial and thought provoking topics, while others may feel as if these kinds of heavy debates are out of place. Video game servers tend to have a no-politics rule to avoid negative debates and personal attacks that are beyond the scope of the video game(s) in question. Servers centered around memes, irl, or social communities can be much more topical and have looser rules, while servers centered around mental health or marginalized communities can lean towards a stricter on-topic only community policy.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>What would I like to foster in my community? </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While knowing what to avoid and moderate is very useful, having an idea of what kind of atmosphere you’d like the server to have goes far in setting the mood for the rest of the community at large. If users notice moderators are engaging in good-faith and positive conversations and condemning toxic or hateful discussion, it is more likely that your users will join in and participate in that positive conversation. If they see you and your mod team have taken the initiative to preserve the good atmosphere of the community, they are moved to put in the effort to reciprocate.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Evaluating Types of Harmful Rhetoric</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This section will be more specific and will break down the most common ways in which a user can engage in harmful rhetoric, how to de-escalate discussions that attack marginalized communities, and how to properly address uncommon symbols used to attack communities.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Harmful Terms and Ableist Language</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Members of your community may use obscure symbols or terms to send an offensive message while avoiding any blatant attention or triggering filters. While some of these will be used under the guise of being “internet culture” it’s important to be cognizant that these symbols and language can cause a lot of pain to many marginalized people. Understanding and approaching these terms seriously will help mitigate any long-term server culture damage and personal damage this kind of behavior can cause. This will not only be symbols, but popular terms that are used to cause intentional discourse and push harmful narratives.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">These are all terms and symbols used to specifically target and belittle groups of people, and are harmful to the growth of a welcoming environment for your community. Some are slurs, while some are generally harmful rhetoric;</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Ableist Terms</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Autistic, Autist, Retard, etc: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Very common ableist terms used to insult users on their intelligence. Commonly used as slurs to attack neurodivergent people, and should be avoided if possible.</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To be particular, ‘retard’ is a slur specifically to attack neurodivergent people. ‘Autistic’ can be used neutrally by autistic people to refer to themselves, and it should only be moderated if it is being used as an insult.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Handicap/Mentally Retarded/Defective: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Similar to above, used to refer to users in an accusatory manner, particularly to attack their intelligence or capabilities as people. Can also be used in an indirect manner with just as much harmful subtext; for example calling a character in a game a “wheelchair character even the mentally defective could play”.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Racist Terms</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Jap: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Used during World War II when the Japanese were in internment camps in the US, this term was a derogatory way US citizens referred to Japanese people and is heavily considered an ethnic slur against Japanese people. </span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Gypsy/Gypped: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Both to refer to ‘Gypsy’ the people, and to be robbed/conned in the form of ‘gypped’, this is a term specifically used as an ethnic slur against the Romani people. While it is used in legal contexts, the words have slowly been brought out of use due to its common use as a slur historically.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Chink/Ching Chong: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Chink has been historically used as a slur against people of Chinese descent, and sometimes even Asian decent widely, with ching chong mocking the language of the Chinese which is commonly used alongside chink.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Triple Parentheses, also known as (((echo))): </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This is a very uncommon but recently used symbol to denote someone of Jewish origin, typically in a way to target or harass them. This symbol is used to single Jewish people out by communities and places a target on their back for their religion or ethnicity, and should not be tolerated.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>LGBTQ+ Specific Slurs</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Dyke/Lesbo: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A term originated as a slur against more masculine-presenting lesbian women, this term has been reappropriated by its community into being a common slang term to refer to lesbian women. While some people would not mind being called a dyke, it should be made aware of it’s possible negative downsides for people who may be uncomfortable with the term.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Thing: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Specifically in reference to pronouns, the use of ‘thing’ instead of a user’s preferred pronouns, used to usually mock a user’s preferred way of expressing their gender identity, is commonly used as a way to invalidate or minimalize trans/enby people.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Fag/Faggot/Homo: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">All terms used to refer to gay people, and all heavy slurs with the intention of belittling and attacking them. These words are also commonly used in the real world when they are attacked, and should not be taken lightly.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Trap: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A term that originated from anime, this word is in reference to men who dress as females and look female-presenting, and ‘trap’ heterosexual people into having an attraction to them. This word has been used out of its original contexts as a slur to transgender people, as if their existence is to ‘trap’ or ‘trick’ people around them. Not everyone finds this term offensive, and definitely should be evaluated as a team if it deserves moderation on a case-by-case basis.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While some of these terms may be popular in certain spaces (such as gaming), it’s important to understand the history and weight behind them, and think accordingly about their place in your server long-term.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Creating an LGBTQ+ Friendly Environment </span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Online platforms tend to have a large amount of hateful content and rhetoric used against marginalized groups of people. When crafting a community, there has to be a common goal of acceptance and welcoming that you provide for all of your members. In online communities, it is not uncommon for users to voice their disdain at other users for their choices in pronouns, gender presentation, or anything that relates them to the LGBTQ+ community.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What is an Ally?</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An ally is someone who is not a part of the LGBTQ+ umbrella who supports and ‘allies’ with the community to create an open and welcoming atmosphere in your server, it is important to understand your role in being an ally to your community and to your users. Moderation is a key component in allowing people to present themselves openly in your server and grow long-lasting connections with other members. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What are Pronouns?</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Pronouns are what people use to refer to a person without directly stating their name. Common pronouns are They/Them, She/Her, and He/Him. There are many others that are not covered here, but pronouns can be very important to someone’s identity and how they’d prefer to be addressed. Users, at one point or another, may make jokes such as calling users incorrect pronouns intentionally to invalidate their identity, dehumanize them, and humiliate members of the community out of their ability to interact within the server. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Additionally, it’s worth noting that comments such as ‘there are only two genders’ are used to directly disrespect and undermine the trans community, without directly appearing confrontational. This is used to skirt by rules by appearing to be much less antagonizing than these words truly are.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What are Important LGBTQ+ Terms to Know?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are a few LGBTQ+ specific terms that are good to be aware of when interacting with LGBTQ+ members of your community. It’s important to also keep up with your communities- it can be helpful to do some research as terms and issues pop up. Quickly Googling a new term that you come across from a member can make them feel much more welcome in the community as a whole and address sore spots as well.</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Enby/NB/Genderqueer: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Non-binary, a term to describe a person whose gender identities don’t fit into the gender binary (female and male). (NB is an acronym that is also used for “non-black” in some contexts)</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>AMAB/AFAB: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Terms to describe what gender someone was originally born as, usually in contrast to what gender they present as now. AMAB is ‘Assigned Male at Birth’ meaning that someone\'s birth certificate says “male” on it, and AFAB is ‘Assigned Female at Birth’ meaning that someone\'s birth certificate says “female” on it.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">These are also some terms to be aware of that are related to LGBTQ+ issues that you may see being brought up: </span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Chaser: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A term to describe a cisgender person who fetishizes or objectifies transgender people (most often transgender women), and seeks out relationships with them.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>TERF</strong> or <strong>Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist</strong>: A term for gender-critical individuals who consider themselves feminists who do not acknowledge transgender women as women and promote the exclusion of trans women from women\'s spaces and organizations. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderating Hateful Content</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When it comes to the content you allow or moderate in your server, it’s important to, again, reflect on what type of community you are. It’s also important that you act quickly and precisely on this type of harmful behavior. Some users will slowly push boundaries on what type of language they can ‘get away with’ before being moderated.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When discussing moderation, a popular theory that circulates is called the </span><strong>broken windows theory</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. This theory expresses that if there are signs of antisocial behavior, civil unrest and disorder, as well as visible signs of crimes in the area, that it encourages further anti-social behavior and crime. Similarly, if you create an environment in which toxic and hateful behavior is common, the cycle will perpetuate into further toxicity and hatefulness. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What is Bad-Faith Content vs. Good-Faith Content?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">‘Bad-faith’ content is a term that describes behavior done intentionally to cause mischief, drama, or  toxicity to a community. They are also commonly referred to as </span><strong>bad actors</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, and are the type of people that should be swiftly dealt with and addressed directly. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">‘Good-faith’ content is a term that describes user behavior with good intentions. When users are a positive foundation in your community, the members that join and interact with the established community will grow to adapt and speak in a way that continues the positive environment that has been fostered and established. It’s important to note that while ‘good-faith’ users are generally positive people, it is possible for them to state wrong or sometimes even harmful words. The importance of this distinction is that these users can be educated from their mistakes and adapt to the behavior you expect of them. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When users toe the line, they are not acting within good faith. As moderators, you should be directly involved enough to determine what is bad-faith content and remove it. On the other hand, education is important in the community sphere for long term growth. While you can focus on removing bad behavior from bad-faith users, reform in good-faith community members who are uneducated in harmful rhetoric should also be a primary goal when crafting your community. When interacting in your community, if you see harmful rhetoric or a harmful stereotype, step back and meaningfully think about the implications of leaving content up in channels that use this kind of language. Does it:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Enforce a negative stereotype?</li>\\n<li>Cause discomfort to users and the community at large?</li>\\n<li>Create a negative space for users to feel included in the community?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Ideas to Help Prioritize Inclusivity</span></h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Allowing users to have pronouns on their profile.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Depending on your server, you may choose to have pronoun roles that members can directly pick from to display on their profile. This is a way to allow users to express their pronouns in a way that doesn’t isolate them. When creating a larger, more welcoming system for pronouns, it is much harder to decide who has pronouns because they are LGBTQ+, because they’re an ally, or just because it was part of setting up their roles. When servers have pronoun systems built into them, this can also allow for a community-wide acceptance of pronouns and respect for other users’ identities, and can deter transphobic rhetoric.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Discourage the use of harmful terms. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It’s no secret that terms such as ‘retard’ and ‘trap’ are used in certain social circles commonly. As moderators, you can discourage the use of these words in your community’s lexicon.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Create strong bot filters. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Automated moderation of slurs and other forms of hate speech is probably your strongest tool for minimizing the damage bad actors can create in your server. Add variating ways people commonly try to skip over the filter as well (for example, censoring a word with an added or subtracted letter that commonly is used as a slur).</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A good document to follow for bot filter and auto moderation as a whole is also in the Discord Mod Academy, which can be found </span><a href=\\"https://dis.gd/dma321\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">here</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">! </span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Educating your community. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Building a community without toxicity takes a lot of time and energy. The core of all moderation efforts should be in educating your communities, rewarding good behavior, and making others aware of the content they are perpetuating.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>A core way to handle all de-escalation stands in your approach. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Users, when heated up during a frustrating or toxic discussion, are easy to set off or to accidentally escalate to more toxicity. The key is to type calmly, and to make sure with whatever manner you approach someone to de-escalate, you do it in a way that is understood to be for the benefit of everyone involved.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Closing</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Creating a healthy community that leaves a lasting, positive impact in its members is difficult. Moderators have to be aware, educated, and always on the lookout for things they can improve on. By taking the initiative on this front, your community can grow into a positive, welcoming place for all people, regardless of their race, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Other Resources</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Below are resources for further research and discussion on different types of slurs, symbols, and hate speech not referenced explicitly in this document. </span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<a href=\\"https://www.adl.org\\"><strong>https://www.adl.org</strong></a> <span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">- Hate Speech Database</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<a href=\\"http://www.forbiddensymbols.com\\"><strong>http://www.forbiddensymbols.com</strong></a> <span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">- Hate Symbol Database</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<a href=\\"http://www.rsdb.org\\"><strong>http://www.rsdb.org</strong></a><strong> -</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Racial Slur Database</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><br><br></p>"')

Managing such a team is a straining task but extremely important to the overall health of a community. In this article, you’ll get an in-depth look into what you need to establish and maintain a positive and productive environment within your moderation team.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Getting to Know Your Team</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Above all else, the foundation of a good moderation team is familiarity. By knowing your fellow moderators better, what they do, or where they live, you’ll relate to them better. You’ll get to know people’s strengths and weaknesses, learn to understand them better, and get a feeling for when they need help, and vice versa. Though you all may be in different time zones and have diverse backgrounds you’re all working towards the same goal which is keeping the community you all care for safe. Who knows- you might find that you share a lot of the same interests along the way, make great new friends, or deepen existing friendships during your time together as moderators.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Here are a few basic things you should do to familiarize with each other:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><strong>Introducing yourself. </strong></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Let moderators post a small introduction about themselves for existing and new moderators. This will give everyone in the team a basic understanding of where they’re coming from.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><strong>Engage new moderators. </strong></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Just like in any relationship, talking with each other is a part of the process. Engage new moderators with conversations, and make them feel welcome in the team.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><strong>Keep in touch with moderators. </strong></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Offer help to your moderators, or check on them if they haven’t been seen for a while. Sharing positive feedback is also a great way to stay in touch with your moderators! Positive, specific feedback is one of the best ways to recognize all of the hard, often thankless work, that your moderators do. <strong><br></strong></span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><strong>Maintain a channel for off topic discussions. </strong></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Keep a channel for casual conversations for your moderators, letting them talk about their interests and getting to know each other better. Just because they’re here in a position of power does not mean that they’re incapable of having fun or talking about things outside of the immediate state of the server. <br></span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><strong>Hold Voice Chat Sessions. </strong></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While talking through text is great- especially when trying to get more long form thoughts across- encouraging people to hop into voice to speak more casually can help to keep your mods personable and engaged with one another if they can put a voice to their fellow mods’ usernames.<strong><br></strong></span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Allocating Resources</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A moderation team needs a clear structure and a unified understanding of server moderation, which has already been covered in a previous segment: </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000178021\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">302 - Developing moderator guidelines</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. Now we’re going to expand on how to utilize each and every single moderator\'s abilities further. A moderation team can range from a few members in a small server to a huge team with 30 or more staff depending on the server size. The bigger your community gets the more the team needs to be organized. While they are all moderators, it doesn’t mean they all do the same job.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some of your moderators, especially experienced moderators, are likely to be in more administrative positions. They usually stay further away from general day-to-day channel moderation while newer moderators are focused on watching conversations and enforcing the server rules. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you do have one of these larger mod teams, consider delegating certain moderators to tasks and responsibilities that they’d be best suited for, rather than having a jack of all trades, master of none situation. This allows to divide the team into smaller sub-teams that talk to each other more frequently in designated channels regarding their specific mod duties.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Here are a few examples of sub-teams that are common within larger communities:</span></p>\\n<h4>Example 1: Chat Moderators</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderators that primarily contribute to the community by enforcing rules, watching conversations, engaging members, solving member to member conflicts and showing moderation presence. The same type of moderators could also exist for Voice Channels, but that is mostly for very large communities.</span></p>\\n<h4>Example 2: Bot Managers</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderators that are extremely familiar with permissions, bots, programming, etc. Ideally, they aren’t just able to operate bots you’re using, but also maintain them. A custom bot tailored to your community is always something to consider. Having a bot hosted “in-house” by a moderator within your team adds an additional layer of security. The Bot Team is very valuable in making new and creative ideas possible and especially in automating day-to-day processes. </span></p>\\n<h4>Example 3: Event Supervisors</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Most servers host events, from community run events to events run by staff members. Event Supervisors watch over the community members hosting events, watching out for new events, while being the general point of communication in hosting and announcing them. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">These are ways of how moderators can be utilized better by giving them a designated job depending on your team\'s size, and also giving them the ability to dive into certain topics of moderation more in-depth within your community, which overall makes managing and coordinating a team as a whole easier.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Decision Making</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As server size and the number of moderators increases, the harder it becomes to hear every voice and opinion. As a team, decisions need to be made together, they need to be consistent, equitable, and take into account as many different opinions as possible.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It’s important to establish a system, especially when making big decisions. Often, there are decisions that need to be done right at the very moment. For example, when someone posts offensive content. In most cases, a moderator will act on their perception of the rules and punish offenders accordingly. At that very moment, the offending content has to be removed, leaving little to no time to gather a few staff members and make a decision together. This is where consistency comes into play. The more your moderators share equal knowledge and the same mindset, the more consistent moderation actions get. This is why it’s important to have moderator guidelines and a clear structure.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It’s very important to give every moderator freedom so they don’t have to ask every time before they can take action, but it’s also important to hear out as many opinions on any major server changes as possible, if time allows it.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Growth</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Over time, a moderation team grows. They grow in many ways, in their abilities, in the number of moderators, but also grow together as a team. Every new moderation team will face challenges they need to overcome together and every already established team will face new situations that they have to adapt to and deal with. It’s important to give a moderator something to work towards. Mods should look forward to opportunities that will strengthen their capabilities as a moderator and strengthen the team’s performance as a whole.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You should let moderators know that they have the potential for growth in their future as a moderator. It can be something like specializing into specific topics of moderation, like introducing them into managing or setting up bots. Perhaps over time they will progress to a senior moderator and focus more on the administrative side of things. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Discord Mod Academy can be a valuable resource in encouraging moderator growth as well. While they may be familiar with some of the concepts in the Discord Moderation Academy, no moderator can know everything and these articles have the potential to further refine their moderation knowledge and enhance their abilities.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Professionalism</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderators are direct representatives of your community and as such should be a reflection of what an ideal community member looks like. Many things tie into showing this professionalism, ranging from how moderators chat with members in public to consistency in moderator actions. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The presence of a moderator should never make people uncomfortable - there needs to be a fine line between “I can chat with this moderator like with any other member” and “This is a moderator and I need to take what they\'re saying seriously”. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Here are a few attributes in what makes a moderation team look and be professional:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Competency. </strong>A moderator needs to be able to express moderation knowledge and articulate themselves well, so they can explain any actions taken on members with competence.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Reliability. </strong>The team should plan ahead of time, and a moderator should commit to what they say they would deliver, and if they can’t, they should take responsibility for it.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Integrity. </strong>Moderators are also a contributory factor of morality, ethics and equality and should demonstrate being the golden standard to their community.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Self-control. </strong>A moderator will often face the situation of members not agreeing to actions taken against them. In those often heated conversations with an irate member, moderators need to keep self control by staying calm and resolving the issue.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Professional Image. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderators need to maintain a professional image- this includes things like choosing your profile picture, status, nickname, or any other highly visible identifiers wisely. While typing quirks and a friendly tone can go a long way to engender familiarity among your server members, when engaging in moderator actions it’s also important to say things in a way that are definitive and official. It’s hard to take a moderator seriously when they’re typing with tons of grammar mistakes and sporting a borderline nsfw profile picture.</span></p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Your team should share positivity, engage conversation, show respect for others and maintain a professional look. Make it clear to your moderation team that they are a highly visible and perhaps incredibly scrutinized group within your community- and to conduct themselves appropriately with those aspects in mind. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Problem Solving </span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As with all group efforts, there is a possibility for friction to occur within a moderation team. This is undoubtedly something that you’re all going to have to address at some point in your mod team’s lifespan. It’s very important to deal with these situations as soon as they come up. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Many people don\'t feel comfortable dealing with conflict directly as it can be uncomfortable. However, getting to any potential problems before they become serious can prevent more severe issues from cropping up in the future. The goal of a problem-solving process is to make a moderation team more conflict-friendly. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As a general problem solving process, you should: </span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Identify the issue a moderator/a group of moderators/or a member has</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Understand the opinions and interests of everyone</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">List and evaluate possible solutions</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Settle on a satisfactory solution</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">With that in mind, there are also situations where you’d want to exercise more discretion. Something that might prompt this is when a moderator makes a mistake. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It can be both uncomfortable and embarrassing to be “called out” for something, so often enough the best option is to speak to someone privately if you think they’ve made a mistake. After the moderator understands the situation and acknowledges the mistake, the problem can be talked about with the rest of the team, mainly to prevent situations like these in the future. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Still, sometimes there are situations where problems can’t be solved and things get more and more heated, and in the end separating is unavoidable. Moderators leave on their own or have to be removed. Your team members should always be given the option to take a break from moderation- especially to avoid burnout. You can learn more about how to deal with moderator burnout in </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058645534\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">course 311.</a></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Reviewing</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Taking a moment to look back at the history and progression of your community and your mod team can be a useful way to evaluate where your team is at and where it needs to be. The time frame can be of your choosing, but some common intervals can be monthly, quarterly, or half year. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You don’t always get to talk with your moderators every day - most of us volunteer, moderating as a hobby, having our own lives while living scattered all over the world. With all of that going on it can be hard to find the time or space to discuss things that you might feel are lacking or could be changed regarding the server, and that’s why reviewing is important.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A Community Review can be done in many ways. For most, a channel asking a few basic questions, like how the community has developed since the last review, how activity and growth has changed, is a good way to start. Most importantly, you want to hear how the moderation team is doing. Talk about mistakes that have happened recently, how they can be prevented, and review some of the moderator actions that have been taken. A review allows everyone to share their thoughts, see what everyone is up to, and deal with more long term issues. It also allows giving your moderators feedback on their performance.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The essence of managing a moderation team is to be open-minded, communicate and to listen to each other. Endeavor to manage decisions and confront problems in an understanding, calm, and professional way. Give moderators the opportunity to grow, designated tasks, but also time to review, break and rest. Remember, you’re in this together!</span></p>\\n<p> </p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">So, you’ve set up your server and established some rules! The next step is enforcing those rules. A large component of enforcing your rules and protecting your server is auto moderation. This article will cover general and specific implementations and configurations of Auto moderation both with the aid of tools Discord has readily available, and tools provided by bots. Before reading on, please read the terminology below.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Terminology</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><strong>‘Raid’ ‘Raider’</strong> - A raid is where a large number of users will join a server with the express intention of causing issues for the server. A raider is an account engaging in this activity.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><strong>‘Alt’ ‘Alt account’</strong> - An alt is a throwaway account owned by a discord user. In the context of raids, these alts are made en masse to engage in raiding.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><strong>\\"Self-bot\\"</strong> - A self bot is an account that’s being controlled via custom code or tools. This is against Discord’s TOS. In the context of raids and moderation, these accounts are automated to spam, bypass filters or engage in other annoying activities.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Why is Auto Moderation Important?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Auto Moderation as a system is integral to the way many servers run on Discord. The security that auto moderation can provide to your server can give your users a much better experience in your community, make your moderator’s jobs easier, and prevent malicious users from doing damage to </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">your server or even getting into your server.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Auto Moderation vs. Manual Moderation</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you’re a well established server, you’ll likely already have a moderator team. You may wonder, why should I use auto moderation? I already have moderators? </span><strong>Auto moderation isn’t a replacement for manual moderation, rather, it’s something that enriches it. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Your moderation team can continue to make context-based, informed decisions within your server, and auto moderation servers to make that process easier for them while dealing with common issues faster than they may be able to.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Knowing What’s Right for Your Server</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Different servers will warrant different levels of auto moderation. It’s important to be able to evaluate your server and consider what level of auto moderation will suit it. Below are the different kinds of servers on Discord and the recommended auto moderation systems for them.</span></p>\\n<h4>Private Servers</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you run a Discord server with limited invites, where every new member is known, auto moderation won’t be critical unless you have a larger member count. It’s recommended to have some auto moderation, namely text filters and anti-spam.</span></p>\\n<h4>Public Servers</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you run a Discord server with public invites where new members could be just about anyone, it’s strongly recommended to have anti-spam and text filters as well as some level of member verification. If your server is large (several thousand members) implementing anti-raid features may be necessary. Remember- auto moderation is configurable to your rules, as strict or loose as they may be.</span></p>\\n<h4>Verified, Partnered, and Community Servers</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If your Discord server is lucky enough to be Verified or Partnered, you will need to adhere to additional guidelines (<a href=\\"https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024871991-Discord-Partnership-Code-of-Conduct\\">Partner Code of Conduct</a> and/or Verified Server Guidelines) to maintain that status. Auto moderation is recommended for these servers to enforce these guidelines, namely anti spam and text filters. If you have a Vanity URL or your server is </span><a href=\\"https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030843331-How-to-enable-your-server-for-Server-Discovery\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discoverable</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, anti-raid is a must-have to protect your server. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Any community that enables community features in their server settings must also adhere to the</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> </span><a href=\\"https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035969312-Public-Server-Guidelines\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Community Server Guidelines</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, which holds communities to higher standards of overall health and effective moderation.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Discord Moderation Menu</span></h3>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\\"><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360099059034/image_2020-12-07_223516.png\\" alt=\\"image_2020-12-07_223516.png\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\\"><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360101288853/image_2020-12-07_223538.png\\" alt=\\"image_2020-12-07_223538.png\\" width=\\"588\\" height=\\"548\\"> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the most powerful tools in auto moderation comes with your server, the moderation tab. Located under the server settings tab, you will find the moderation settings. Within this page are some of the most powerful tools Discord has to offer!</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">These settings can help keep your Discord server nice and secure without an elaborate setup. The individual settings will be detailed below!</span></p>\\n<h4><span class=\\"wysiwyg-color-black\\"><a href=\\"https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/216679607-What-are-Verification-Levels-\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Verification Level</span></a></span></h4>\\n<p><strong>None*</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - This turns off verification for your server, anyone can join and immediately interact with your server. This isn’t recommended for public servers, as anyone with malicious intent can immediately join and wreak havoc.</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span></p>\\n<p><strong>Low</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - This requires people joining your server to have a verified email, this will protect your server from the laziest of malicious users while keeping everything simple and accessible for well-meaning users. This would be a good setting for a small, private server.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Medium</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - This requires the user to have a verified email address </span><strong>and</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> for their account to be at least 5 minutes old. This will further protect your server from people creating accounts solely to cause problems. This would be a good setting for a moderately sized private server or a small public server.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>High</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - This includes the same protection as both the medium and low verification levels but also adds a 10 minute barrier between someone joining your server and being able to interact. This can give you and anyone else responsible for keeping things clean in your server time to respond to ‘raids’, or large numbers of malicious users joining at once. For legitimate users, you can encourage them to do something with this 10 minute time period such as read the rules and familiarize themselves with informational channels to pass the time until the waiting period is over. This would be a good setting for a large public server.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Highest</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - This requires a joining user to have a verified phone number in addition to the above requirements. This setting can be bypassed by robust ‘raiders’. This would be a good setting for a private server where security is tantamount, or a public server with custom verification. This requirement is one many normal Discord users won’t fill, by choice or inability.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Explicit media content filter</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As a moderator, one common harassment tactic that trolls may take is to post inappropriate gore, shock, or NSFW content that the rest of your server members would not like to see. Discord provides a robust system to scan images and embeds to make sure such images don’t end up on your server.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Don’t scan any media content*</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Nothing sent in your server will go through Discord’s automagical image filter. This would be a good setting for a small, private server where only people you trust can post images, videos etc.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Scan media content from users without a role*</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Self explanatory, this works well to stop new users from filling your server with unsavoury imagery. When combined with verification methods detailed earlier, this would be a good setting for a moderately sized private or public server.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Scan media content from all members</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - This setting makes sure everyone, regardless of their roles, aren’t posting unsavoury things in your server. In general, we recommend this setting for ALL servers.</span></p>\\n<p><em><strong>*</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">These settings aren’t allowed for a Community server, Verified server or Partnered server as defined earlier in this article</span></em></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once you’ve decided on the base level of auto moderation you want for your server, it’s time to look at the extra levels of auto moderation bots can bring to the table! The next few sections are going to detail the ways in which a bot can moderate.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Bot-Controlled Auto Moderation</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you want to keep your chats clean and clear of certain words, phrases, spam, mentions and everything else that can be misused by would-be troublemakers you’re going to need a little help from a robotic friend or two. A variety of free bots are going to be provided as examples. If you decide to use several bots, you may need to juggle several moderation systems.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When choosing a bot for auto moderation, you should also consider their capabilities for manual moderation (things like managing mutes, warns etc.) and you should find a bot with an infraction/punishment system you and the rest of your moderator team find to be the most appropriate. All of the bots listed in this article have a manual moderation system.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The main and most pivotal forms of auto moderation are:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Anti-Spam</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Text Filters</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Anti-Raid</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">User Filters</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Each of these subsets of auto moderation will be detailed below along with recommended configurations depending on your server.</span></p>\\n<p>Bots seen in this guide:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Mee6 - </span><a href=\\"https://mee6.xyz/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">https://mee6.xyz/</span></a>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Dyno - </span><a href=\\"https://dyno.gg/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">https://dyno.gg/</span></a>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Giselle - </span><a href=\\"https://docs.gisellebot.com/bot-invite.html\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">https://docs.gisellebot.com/bot-invite.html</span></a>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Gaius Cicereius - </span><a href=\\"https://gaiusbot.me/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">https://gaiusbot.me/</span></a>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">YAGPDB - </span><a href=\\"https://yagpdb.xyz/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">https://yagpdb.xyz/</span></a>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Carl - </span><a href=\\"https://carl.gg/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">https://carl.gg/</span></a>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Gearbot - </span><a href=\\"https://gearbot.rocks/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">https://gearbot.rocks/</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> </span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>This list is not exhaustive.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> There are plenty of alternatives available online.

private server, or a public server. Spam, by definition, is irrelevant or unsolicited messages. This covers a wide base of things on Discord, there are multiple types of spam a user can engage in. The common forms are listed in the table above. The most common forms of spam are also very typical of raids, those being </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Fast Messages</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Repeated Text</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. The nature of spam can vary greatly but the vast majority of instances involve a user or users sending lots of messages with the same contents with the intent of disrupting your server.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are subsets of this spam that many anti-spam filters will be able to catch. If any of the following: </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Mentions, Links, Invites, Emoji, and Newline Text</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> are spammed repeatedly in one message or spammed repeatedly across several messages, they will provoke most </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Repeated Text</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Fast Messages</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> filters appropriately. Subset filters are still a good thing for your anti-spam filter to contain as you may wish to punish more or less harshly depending on the spam. Namely, </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Emoji</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Links</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> may warrant separate punishments. Spamming 10 links in a single message is inherently worse than having 10 emoji in a message.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Anti-spam will only act on these things contextually, usually in an </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">X in Y</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> fashion where if a user sends, for example, 10 links in 5 seconds, they will be punished to some degree. This could be 10 links in one message, or 1 link in 10 messages. In this respect, some anti-spam filters can act simultaneously as </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Fast Messages</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Repeated Text</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> filters.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Sometimes, spam may happen too quickly for a bot to catch up. There are rate limits in place to stop bots from harming servers that can prevent deletion of individual messages if those messages are being sent too quickly. This can often happen in raids. As such, </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Fast Messages</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> filters should prevent offenders from sending messages; this can be done via a mute, kick or ban.

catch-all filter with carl will prevent link-specific spam detection</span></em></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A text filter is integral to a well moderated server. It’s strongly, strongly recommended you use a bot that can filter text based on a blacklist. A </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Banned words</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> filter can catch links and invites provided </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">http://</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">https://</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> are added to the word blacklist (for all links) or specific full site URLs to block individual websites. In addition, </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">discord.gg</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> can be added to a blacklist to block ALL Discord invites.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Banned Words</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> filter is integral to running a public server, especially if it’s a Partnered, Community or Verified server, as this level of auto moderation is highly recommended for the server to adhere to the additional guidelines attached to it. Before configuring a filter, it’s a good idea to work out what </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">is</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">isn’t</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> ok to say in your server, regardless of context. For example, racial slurs are generally unacceptable in almost all servers, regardless of context. Banned word filters often won’t account for context, with an explicit blacklist. For this reason, it’s also important a robust filter also contains whitelisting options. For example, if you add the slur </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">‘nig’</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> to your filter and someone mentions the country </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">‘</span></em><strong><em>Nig</em></strong><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">eria’</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> they could get in trouble for using an otherwise acceptable word.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Filter immunity may also be important to your server, as there may be individuals who need to discuss the use of banned words, namely members of a moderation team. There may also be channels that allow the usage of otherwise banned words. For example, a serious channel dedicated to discussion of real world issues may require discussions about slurs or other demeaning language, in this exception channel based </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Immunity</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> is integral to allowing those conversations.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Link filtering is important to servers where sharing links in ‘general’ chats isn’t allowed, or where there are specific channels for sharing such things. This can allow a server to remove links with an appropriate reprimand without treating a transgression with the same severity as they would a user sending a racial slur.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Whitelisting/Blacklisting and templates for links are also a good idea to have. While many servers will use catch-all filters to make sure links stay in specific channels, some links will always be malicious. As such, being able to filter specific links is a good feature, with preset filters (Like the google filter provided by YAGPDB) coming in very handy for protecting your user base without intricate setup however, it is recommended you </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">do</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> configure a custom filter to ensure specific slurs, words etc. that break the rules of your server, aren’t being said.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Invite filtering is equally important in large or public servers where users will attempt to raid, scam or otherwise assault your server with links with the intention of manipulating your user base to join or where unsolicited self-promotion is potentially fruitful. Filtering allows these invites to be recognized, and dealt with more harshly. Some bots may also allow by-server white/blacklisting allowing you to control which servers are ok to share invites to, and which aren’t. A good example of invite filtering usage would be something like a partners channel, where invites to other, closely linked, servers are shared.

What’s healthy for one server may not actually be healthy for another! For example, it wouldn’t be the best idea to run a wholesome Animal Crossing fan group the same way as a Doom Eternal server.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Despite this, there are still many things that all healthy communities share. Most notably, they foster </span><strong>meaningful conversations</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> through a </span><strong>positive, welcoming environment</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, all while maintaining a </span><strong>balance between fun and safety</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A Note On Quality vs. Quantity</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Many people assume that a community is “healthy” based on how many members it has and how active it is. While that can be a factor, those numbers alone can’t describe the </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">quality</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> of a community. The amount of activity may provide some insight but without looking deeper, there isn’t a way to know for sure. A massive, 500,000 member server might be flooded with multiple messages per second, but this provides little information about the quality or atmosphere of the conversations it contains.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Don’t be discouraged if the server doesn’t have a massive amount of members!</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Small communities thrive just as well as large ones, and as a bonus, they’re easier to moderate.

They </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">will</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> take note of how you act, and since you’re in a place of authority, what you do indirectly affects what they do. This shouldn’t need to be said, but a community cannot be healthy when there are moderators who are disrespectful, break their own rules, or encourage toxicity.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Guide Conversations</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Whether it’s bringing up a cool topic or steering away from a dark one, you have many opportunities to gently guide conversations in meaningful directions. When a subject is becoming sensitive, argumentative, or just downright wrong, try to change the topic. If it continues, you should politely ask the people involved to drop it, or to move to a </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060486873\\" target=\\"_self\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">different channel</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> if one exists for it.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Don’t Tolerate Toxicity</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Stomping out useless negativity, rudeness, and other toxicity is one of the most important things moderators must do. This can be easier said than done, especially if someone is being borderline but not </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">quite</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> breaking any rules. Many moderators get confused and wonder what they should do in these kinds of situations, and they may be afraid to do anything, as they think there’s nothing to justify it. The truth is, if someone is </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">knowingly</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> making others uncomfortable, </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">even if they aren’t breaking any rules</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, it’s still the right thing to take action on them - especially if they’ve already been warned multiple times.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Balancing Fun and Freedom with Safety</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Don’t go overboard and just ban sadness, though. Your community members should be able to be themselves (within reason). Let them joke around, have fun, make memes, make friends, support each other, develop inside jokes, etc... without constantly breathing down their neck. Participate with them! While you should always step in as a moderator as needed, that doesn’t mean that you have to alienate yourself from the community.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This balance between being strict and lenient is important. There are many things that must be enforced, but doing so without hurting community health can be difficult. On the other hand, you don’t want to let your server get out of control. You should definitely be strict with the most important boundaries (such as disallowing spam, slurs, etc), but the others, depending on the behavior of the community, are up to you.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Watch Out for Attention-Seeking Behavior</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Occasionally, someone may join the server and constantly attempt to redirect all attention to themselves. They constantly interrupt other conversations with their own, become overly upset if they’re even slightly ignored, or tire everyone out (whether intentionally or not). In some cases, they might frequently tell others that they are depressed. While depression is a real issue, it can be hard to tell whether someone is simply attention-seeking or if they’re genuinely depressed.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The following warning signs can help you identify this behavior:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">They frequently point out that they feel terrible, making sure that everyone knows about it.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">They might not accept help, or they believe that help is useless and won’t work.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">They may force others to be friends with them by threatening to be sad or to hurt themselves.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While receiving support from others is great, this kind of relationship is extremely unhealthy for everyone involved. Consider </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">gently</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> approaching this person and telling them that they’re not in trouble, but they need professional support that a Discord server can’t always provide, like a therapist.</span></p>\\n<p><strong><em>If someone shows signs of being suicidal, </em></strong><strong><em>please spend time with them, and urge them to contact a hotline.</em></strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> You should also </span><a href=\\"https://dis.gd/request\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">contact Discord</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, who may be able to send help their way if you can’t.</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<a href=\\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Suicide prevention hotline</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> (1-800-273-8255)</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">List of other suicide crisis lines</span></a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Community health is a tough thing to get right.

As a guardian of the community, your job is not only to kick out trolls and toxicity, but also to nurture kindness, listen to feedback, and make sure that everyone is having a good time.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Making a server internationally available is a big step for a community. What are things to consider? How does one approach it? What will change in the server dynamics and will it be worth the effort? Here is a step by step guide on how to deal with the internationalization of a community in one Discord server.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Expanding from one Language</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Which languages to choose entirely depend on the type of server you run. For a community server, it is recommended to adjust it to the community’s needs. Usually, the most commonly featured languages outside of English are German, French, Spanish, Turkish and Russian. You can determine your featured language by community analysis, server insights (if your server has them), and demand. What nationalities are represented the most in your server? Which users struggle the most with English upon joining the server and if they’re struggling, what language do they usually communicate in? In addition to that, you can consider starting a survey every time you and your staff feel ready to expand into a new language. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">On the other hand, if you make a server for a brand or company, it is recommended to go by your target audience. Introducing features like internationalization needs carefully planned, but steady steps.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If your server was originally English only, it’s not recommended to expand into too many languages at once for a variety of reasons. Agree on one language (preferably the most popular one in your server) and slowly add on from there, if the need presents itself. Once you figure out a pattern and a stable structure on how to approach the expansion, you can add more sections for different languages.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Server Design</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As your server grows, so does Discord. It is vital to keep in mind that your server can get a lot of incoming users who have never really used Discord before- so make sure your server’s design is user-friendly, easily accessible, and has a clear structure. Also, remember that the more languages you feature on your server, the more text-and voice channels will appear for your staff. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is recommended to hoist the most important text-channels at the top of your server. That may include announcements, server-info, rules, optionally giveaways and more. To ensure global accessibility, translate important parts like the rules and server information in every language you feature alongside your main language.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Additionally, you can add a server guide for easier coordination. Both new users and your staff will benefit from that. It should cover a list of accessible text and voice channels as well as a short but detailed description of each. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Furthermore, try to integrate every additional language in a way that utilizes it to its utmost potential. You can do so in the form of a feedback and suggestion channel in each language’s category. This lets you hear directly from the users that would benefit from that additional language chat the most. Consider having staff that are dedicated to interacting with each section instead of focusing all their attention on the global chat. Having these additional language chats makes it so that your international users don’t feel less validated only because they don’t want to or can’t communicate in the global chat. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You can implement that same line of thinking when organizing server events. Consider alternating between server-wide and international events as demand allows. For the latter, analyze your server’s activity for each region and host it at the time with the most community engagement for those users for the best results. You can apply the same system to the voice channels by creating a few global voice chats and then adding language specific channels. Your staff should only allow one common language to be spoken in the global chats and redirect every other language into their appropriate voice channels. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Creating a Server with One or More Languages From Scratch</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">I</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">f you want to feature multiple languages with equal amounts, you can effectively combine multiple Discord servers in one. For the first half, it will be the same as before: Have at least one international general-chat before you split the server into each language. That way every user is able to communicate with the entirety of the server instead of just their language-specific section. Let users choose their language via a reaction or verification with the option to opt-out and change regions. You can summarise the most important aspects in a common text-channel, the text being translated into every featured language.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The simplest way to manage the split server is by having the same channels and categories, but in different languages. This will heavily depend on the type of server you moderate, but recommended channels for every section are the ones you would usually include in a monolingual server. These channels should include things like rules, announcements, general-chat, bot-commands, media, optionally a looking-for-game channel, and more. Take care to ensure you have appropriate translation for each channel.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moreover, community events can be a lot more diverse. You can host a variety of events for each language as well as let all of them participate in shared events. Take the time to analyze each nation’s activity and also take holidays or national days into account. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Staff Arrangement</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Internationalizing your server may mean that your moderation team grows to be larger than expected, so to make it easy for users to contact the appropriate staff you can separate moderators by nicknames, colors, or role hoist.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Nicknames</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">: If you want to have the moderation team equally displayed throughout the server, you can arrange the moderators by nicknames. Simply add the language they moderate at the beginning of their nickname so they are alphabetically sorted below each other. Users will have an easier time recognizing the appropriate moderators, but with a large staff, this might end up looking a little busy. Some moderators tend to change their nicknames frequently and may not be big fans of having the tag in front of their name, either.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Colors</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">: It is advised to have the colors of each moderator role in the same shade with a slight but still visible difference. This helps to differentiate moderators and regular users will be able to tell the difference immediately. Remember that newer users might not check each role and just contact the first seemingly online moderator they see.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Role hoist</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">: If you display only the accompanying moderator role for each language, ensure that you have a common, not displayed role for all moderators so one team is not less validated than the other. Users should definitely be able to contact the appropriate staff and ping the correct moderators to help them out with issues in chat. but, when displaying a lot of teams with many members each, some of them might be pushed off the screen. You run the risk that some moderators that are displayed below the other teams seem less “important and validated” to the community, but the shared staff role should fix that problem easily. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderation</span></h3>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Recruitment</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While moderating a multilingual server it is crucial to have moderators that are native speakers or at least fluent in each language that you decide to expand to. Having moderators that are native speakers makes it so that they not only understand the textbook definitions of what is being said but understand the cultural contexts that may come with international chats. However, these moderators should also be accomplished and capable with the other responsibilities of being a mod that lie outside of just being fluent.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Responsibilities and Tasks</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While community moderators should follow the basic tasks (moderate the chat, be accessible for questions, guide users), things in multilingual servers can be a bit more advanced. Moderators need to identify and address inappropriate behavior towards other cultures in an authoritative, but instructive way. Furthermore, they need to free the chat from toxic behavior and control discussions about sensitive topics.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In addition to that, they have to be open for cultural questions of users who chose a language they are not fluent in yet. Both the user and staff need to work their way around language barriers together. They’ll be required to help users, as well as resolve disputes, often at the same time. For that, they’ll have to rely on their communication skills in order to succeed in resolving both situations and any other issue that may require it. Without good communication skills, users won\'t understand what you\'re trying to convey to them, which should be assertive but tolerant.</span><strong><br></strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderators can under no circumstances be discriminating towards users of other cultures or beliefs. It is their responsibility to create a civil, welcoming and comfortable environment for all users. While you are always entitled to your own opinion, make sure to keep a neutral output in the public part of the server and try not to let it cloud your judgement.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Managing International Moderator Teams</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Managing several moderators from all around the world can turn out to be quite tricky. Organizing meetings and waiting for everyone’s approval for one date may be a real challenge to deal with. Getting the majority of the team on board could take days, especially with the difference in time zones. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One simple solution is to delegate some captains or representative moderators for each team. They will gather feedback, opinions and suggestions from the rest of the staff team and discuss them with the rest of staff during the meeting. That way it’s easier to organize staff meetings, but they can also directly inform the rest of their team who could not make it due to time conflicts. Depending on the size of the staff teams, you can appoint more than one moderator for that position. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When creating more than one staff role, make sure that everyone is comfortable with their position and their responsibilities. Misalignment can lead to misunderstanding later on, and it might create needless tension amongst the staff. Consider appointing one representative in each region that your server is branching out to. That will open the possibility to have regional staff meetings where language and culture specific issues and suggestions can be discussed without the need for an international meeting with the whole team.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While not every moderator will get the chance to get to know every other moderator from different regions in these larger moderation rosters, it is important that the team feels united regardless. Don’t leave it up to one team to tackle an issue- let them know that they can always ask for help from the rest of the staff.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Bots and ModMail</span></h4>\\n<p><strong>Global Accessibility:</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Make sure that you have the bots available for every part of your server. That could either mean that you include them in the global section of your server, or you translate the commands and definitions in every language featured.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Moderation:</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Since not all moderators will be able to understand every single language, using bots turn out to be very helpful for auto-moderation. Inform your fellow moderators about inappropriate words or phrases and ensure that you added them into the bot filter for easier moderation. Banned or filtered words should contain common slurs in not only English, but also in commonly banned words for every language that you offer. </span></p>\\n<p><strong>Language Barriers:</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> It may occur that users message the ModMail in poor English or in their native language. Find out the user\'s nationality and reply with a message in their native language that lets them know their request is being routed to the appropriately fluent mod. To save these messages, simply create an extra text-channel in the ModMail server and let moderators translate important phrases that might come in handy.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Cultural Awareness</span></h3>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Sensitive Topics</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It\'s easy for people to underestimate the impact cultural differences can have. Culture influences values, rules, thought patterns, and perception.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">That means that events happening in other countries may be viewed differently in each nation. News and social media don\'t always portray the truth which lets misinformation spread easily. Make sure to have your staff updated about the current situations so they have it easier to deal with discussions about sensitive topics and trolls. Communication is key and the users of the server will massively benefit from it. While people are entitled to have their own opinion and ask for further information, make sure to let it happen in a calm and civil atmosphere under a moderator’s watch. If you as a moderator find that you’re ill equipped to talk about the topic, you should refrain from publicly voicing your opinion until you’re better informed. Conversely, you may want to refrain from allowing contentious topics like current events or politics to occur in your server at all, which is something you should decide with your moderation team as a whole. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Final Words</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Making a server internationally available is a great idea and can be a boon to your community’s retention. It can be utilized for both communities and companies alike. But you have to be careful with your approach- Internationalization is a deliberate and complicated process and it should be treated as such. If it’s gone about in the wrong way, left uncompleted or rushed, these international spaces could backfire. It may result in negative feedback, a disappointed community and staff or deserted channels. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Make sure to inform your staff and community about every step you’re about to take, and give them a chance to voice their input. Feedback and suggestions from both your mods and your community will be essential to making sure this is the right fit for your server. Internationalization requires a lot of effort and prioritization in order to properly take care of many factors simultaneously, but if done right, it’s an unparalleled way to enrich your community. </span></p>"')

It should include </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">functions of the staff roles and position to make sure that everyone is on the same page.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Knowledge and Skills:</strong> <span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Your moderators should be both knowledgeable on the technical aspects of moderation as well as possess the proper skills to moderate effectively and efficiently within the structure of your team.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Staff Accountability: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Accountability ensures that the actions that people in power in your server (your staff/mods) are held responsible for the actions that they take. </span></p>\\n<p><strong>Risk Management: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Risk management does not necessarily mean risk </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">avoidance</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. Every server will have to make hard decisions for the sake of maintaining order and increasing participation.  You need to know what impact your potential decisions will make on the community as a whole. Finding a balance between taking risks that can disrupt a server and taking risks that are necessary for the server’s betterment and having a team that is well versed in that makes your community all that more stable and capable. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Decision Making</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When it comes to effective governance structures, it is important to create a process that facilitates decision making. In every aspect of your community, decision making plays a major role. Setting long-term goals and deciding how to advertise the community can be part of that strategy. You also have to think operationally; what punishment is appropriate when a user misbehaves? Decision making is not a static process: it constantly evolves as your community does, it should change to your community’s needs. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A major decision you have to make is how much influence your community members will have and how this affects your governance structure. For example: will members of your community be able to vote for moderator positions? Do you want a community vote on major changes to the server? In most communities there will be a feedback or suggestions channel in which members of the community can influence your decision making process by presenting ideas and proposing changes.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The same question should be asked for your moderators. What influence do they have on your decision making process? Are moderators part of decisions regarding major server changes? Do you have guidelines in place for moderators that determine the length of punishments, or is that decision left up to each moderator? Do you take a proactive approach to get feedback from your moderators, or do you wait passively for suggestions to come in?</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Due to how Discord is set up, there will always be a single owner in charge, but other members of your staff can be responsible for different types of decisions. When you want to implement a change or when you open up suggestions, you have to clearly define how decisions will be made. Here are some options to consider: </span></p>\\n<p><strong>Voting: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You could opt to go the democratic route when making decisions. This can either be a public vote where members are involved or the vote could be amongst members of your staff. You can decide whether or not the vote should be a majority or unanimous decision. You should also be clear if, when, and why someone, such as the server owner, can veto a decision if you choose voting as your decision making process.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Compromising: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You can also choose to look for a compromise among members of your staff or the community. In this instance, you question the decision itself and change it until everyone is satisfied with the outcome. A compromise might result in decisions you initially did not think of, but can also take longer. </span></p>\\n<p><strong>Deciding: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You could simply make decisions as the server owner and present them as changes rather than something up for discussion. In this case, you eliminate influence from other members of the community, but decisions are made much faster. </span></p>\\n<p><strong>Ranking: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When multiple options are present, those could be ranked based on different factors such as pros and cons. Ranking can be more insightful than a simple vote, which will result in a better understanding of different opinions. </span></p>\\n<p><strong>Consensus: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When nobody objects to a suggestion, you could make a decision based on consensus. </span></p>\\n<p><strong>Experience: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some members of your community or staff might be highly skilled in a certain area and you could ask them to make a decision based on their experience. This could be the case in decisions about new features of a bot you are using. Someone experienced in programming might be more aware of the limitations of Discord.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Decision making is a vital part of your community as it affects both your governance as well as your vision of the community as a whole. Having good decision making processes in place ensures a better structure for your community and staff. It translates into better understanding of responsibilities, it improves ownership of the community, and further clarifies your governance structure.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Team Structures</span></h3>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Horizontal vs. Vertical Hierarchy</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A community’s structure can be generally divided in a horizontal and vertical hierarchy. Most communities choose a vertical approach in which they define different roles by assigning them specific tasks. Classically speaking, this will be your owner, admins and moderators, but of course this might be different depending on your community’s needs. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some communities opt for a more horizontal approach; different members of the staff or community are responsible and accountable for different areas and tasks. Of course, you do not have to choose between either and they can coexist. Keep in mind that you will always have a server owner so every server will have a vertical hierarchy to this extent.   </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Each community will have a different structure. Some communities have major involvement of members of the community, while others are strictly run by a single person. Most communities however have a structure of the owner, admins and moderators. The owner is tasked with strategic decisions in regards to the community and the team. They formulate the vision of the community, set long-term goals, define roles and values and so on. Admins will be in charge of the moderation team, onboard new moderators, handle appeals, manage channels and handle moderator complaints. Moderators will be handling the day-to-day tasks. This is a vertical approach in which each position is higher or lower in a formal hierarchy.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A horizontal structure consists of tasks or responsibilities shared between members of your staff. Moderators could be responsible for different channels rather than the server as a whole, or some could be tasked to deal with ban appeals while others might be more community-oriented and focus on feedback channels. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Both systems can coexist and have their own value. In a vertical system, everyone has a clear role with tasks, where the horizontal system introduces more ownership and responsibilities to the team. Members of the team will be more accountable for their responsibilities than in a vertical system. Ownership within a horizontal system translates to being more involved in the server’s mission, vision and values as members of your team will be directly responsible for areas that have an impact on those. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Comparing Exemplary Structures</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As mentioned before, when creating a governance structure for your Discord there really isn’t a one size fits all layout. One key aspect of a working governance structure is that it is settled in that it is stable, but also fluid in that it is flexible. There will be the need for constant adjustments and improvements over time, so try to let go of “old systems” and focus on what benefits your Discord server the most. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Our first example will be a typical </span><strong>pyramid, </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">mainly vertically focused governance, which would normally look like this: </span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">At the very top, you have one or very few people who are in charge of everything (this could be the server owner, CEO, or similar). Having a few people at the top will make it easier to aim straight for the goal of the server without much discussion or distraction in the higher ranks. </span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Following them there will be administrators or some sort of management - usually, they will be in charge of back-end work and they will report to the highest role.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Right below them will be senior or head moderators who handle a variety of tasks, ranging from promoting/demoting moderators, introducing new moderators or handling ban appeals. They will also be the connecting link between higher staff and moderators - the latter take care of the well being of the server for the public eye. </span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Having such a settled, structured system will be good for both the server and the staff team. Everyone knows who they report to, and everyone knows their responsibilities and reach. The struggle of a pyramid system comes when staff members feel like they are not valued enough or disapprove of promotions to higher ranks. It can be a source of tension between staff, and higher staff have the potential to become disconnected from the rest of the server. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A way to prevent those problems can be done by introducing a </span><strong>fluid</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, more horizontally structured hierarchy to the previous system. Fluid being that your government is flexible and allows change when necessary.The drawbacks of too much fluidity could be that it’s easy to lose sight of who does what and who is responsible for what, so make sure that you have properly defined the place and responsibilities of the roles you introduce. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Community Engagement</span></h3>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Feedback and Suggestions</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Along with the previously mentioned components and attributes including the community in your governance mechanics can turn out to be quite fruitful in improving said community. Many server owners and higher staff still have the mindset of “keep everything private, hold the server at bay, control and command”, which means that they act on the server’s behalf without having an actual connection to the community. Getting feedback from your members can combat that.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Receiving feedback can be done through multiple ways, as shown below:</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The easiest way of empowering the community to participate can be done through public channels such as a </span><strong>#feedback </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">or</span><strong> #suggestion channel</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. It is the most straightforward way to get feedback of both positive and negative nature from users and get inspired by any new ideas they might propose. Introduce a responsible staff team that answers and discusses the feedback and suggestions with both users and the rest of staff if there is any useful advice. This team should be focusing on making sure that all of the relevant information is disseminated in an appropriate way as to avoid any confusion or incomplete assumptions made on the uninformed community’s behalf.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As an alternative to using channels in the server itself, you can implement a feedback system by using the </span><strong>ModMail</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> bot. It will allow you to group selected members that can respond while everyone else can see it. Staff can then address the ticket in a closed environment without discussing it in front of the public eye or running the risk of it getting lost in the staff channel. Additionally, it will be easier to contact higher staff and ask for their opinions and finally, it will be easier to archive.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you want to extend the community influence beyond your Discord server, you can use </span><strong>Social Media</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> that represents your server or community on popular platforms like Twitter, Reddit or similar. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">That, and e-governance have proven themselves as useful tools for creating increased transparency and filtering useful feedback. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Influential Members</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Sometimes you may want to have feedback from people that aren’t part of the staff team, but you also don’t want to solicit it from the whole server just yet. You may want to instead, start with asking for feedback from more influential members or highly visible and active members of your server. They may vary from stakeholders to staff from other communities to the most prolific members in your server. The latter will be especially important if your staff team is missing a connection to the active Discord community while they’re working on running the server from behind the scenes. Occasionally staff might think their plans will be an improvement for the server and community, but the community itself may not agree.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To include active and sociable members in your governance, you can give them a special role which can be called something along the lines of “Community Guides”. They won’t quite have the power that normal moderators do - optionally they will have ‘manage messages’ or similar low-level discord permissions - but their main use will be to give feedback on the community’s behalf. They will be the needed link between staff, especially community management, and the Discord users. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While these users don’t need to know everything that’s going on under the hood, you should at least  involve them in changes that will impact their and the rest of the community’s experience on the Discord server. That includes things like changes/addition of roles or channels, community events, and other things along those lines. While the staff decisions hold priority, you should not disregard the community guides’ opinions. They may contradict your original plans and vision, but you should weigh how valuable their knowledge is against how badly you want to implement something and see if you can reach a compromise should that contradiction exist. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Make sure that your selected influential members are trustworthy and don’t leak any information. They should only receive feedback from the public community when they are asked to and they should not assume that they are staff. Nonetheless, their input and time and efforts should be properly acknowledged and appreciated- they, like you, just want to make the community you share a better place. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Having a well organised and structured governance is the key to a successful server and content staff team. The most crucial components to every working server is communication.If your staff team feels like they are at a crossroads or cannot find the obvious solution to a problem on the server, consider seeking out experienced outsiders or the community itself. Even though you may have the best intentions at heart when making decisions for your server, leaning on your carefully crafted community governance structure can open your eyes to solutions that may not have crossed your mind. While not every mentioned feature has to be part of your server, we hope that these guidelines give you an idea of what your server could implement. </span></p>\\n<p><br><br><br></p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A community event is a scheduled gathering of community members to help bring members together and enjoy each other\'s company. A server can run events for many reasons, but with this guide you will hopefully be able to understand the value of hosting events and how to set one up for your community. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In this article you will learn </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">why servers run community events, </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">how to set up an event, and h</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">ow to get people involved in an event.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Why Do Discord Servers Run Events?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A community can run events for a multitude of reasons, whether they are playing a game, celebrating a special event, or just because it\'s Tuesday! Whatever the reason behind the event they all help achieve one goal: </span><strong>boosting participation and bonding with your community. </strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Why do we need to create bonds? </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A community is a group of people who come together for any number of reasons- be it common interests, beliefs, or experiences. These commonalities allow community members to form bonds with one another. Creating these bonds for your community is important because it will help create a sense of ownership between the server and your members. It also allows these individuals to graduate from a regular member to someone who can call your server home. One of the best ways to promote the organic growth of these bonds is through the organization of community events. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How Do You Set Up A Community Event?</span></h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Set a time and a place. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Let everyone know when and where your event is happening; this should preferably be done in an announcement channel where your community is expecting to hear news and updates.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Establish clear expectations. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What type of event is it? </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What rules will you follow during this event?</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>What will you be doing? </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Tell your community what will be happening during this event so those interested can attend.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Open chat and voice channels at the time of the event. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Depending on what the event centered around, you’ll want to be able to communicate with your fellow community members.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Have fun! </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Remember: while you are the organizer for your community’s event you are at the same time, part of your community! Celebrate along with them and do your best to fully enjoy the fruits of your labor.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Who Can Host A Community Event?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Anyone can host a community event provided they have permission from the server staff such as the owner or administrator. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some servers even have a role who’s whole job is to come up with fun events! There are many approaches to deciding who can host events so decide what\'s best for your community.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How Do You Get People Involved in a Community Event?</span></h3>\\n<h4>Keep it relevant</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A good way to get your community involved with an event is to cater to the community you have and build on that: </span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Does your server cater to gamers? </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Do a game night!</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Do you love the same recording artist? </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Chill with a listening party.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Have an active art community? </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Doodle together with a drawing party, exchanging art prompts and ideas!</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Ask questions </h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Asking the right questions can greatly inform the next event that is run. These questions could be asked through a google form or even directly in one of your discussion channels. You could even set these channels up so your community members can give feedback at their leisure. Ensure the questions you ask are those that can be answered easily, but also allow for more meaningful answers. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An example of these questions and some follow-ups are:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Did the time work for everyone? What time would be best for the majority of people?</span></em></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What were some of the more fun parts of the event? Which part did you feel could have been better?</span></em></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Did you enjoy the activity? What are some suggestions for next time?</span></em></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This feedback allows community members to feel like they have a say in the server. It keeps your community invested and engaged because they have a hand in the things that affect them directly.</span></p>\\n<h4>Be Consistent</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Set up a few weeks of recurring events and stick to it! If your community knows what to expect they can plan around your events and make it a part of their schedule. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What to do if people are late? That’s up to you to decide! If you’re running an event for a smaller, more intimate group, it may be worth waiting a few extra minutes to allow everyone to attend. This may not be advisable for bigger communities with many people as it may not be convenient for those who attended on time. Use your best judgement to decide what fits best for your community.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A major factor of keeping your community involved is by keeping them entertained. Make the event fun. Talk with your community, interact with them, thank them for joining in and being a great member of the community. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Reward Your Community</span></h4>\\n<p>Another way to get a larger turnout for a community event is host giveaways. However, something to keep in mind: giving away stuff is great, but don’t make it the central focus. Your community should attend your events because they’re looking for fun and camaraderie not because they want to snag some loot. Employ some rules to ensure that they are participating. E.g.: Play and win one game with us to win a month of Discord Nitro. What are examples of good rewards versus bad rewards? Should they be temporary, or permanent? On the platform, or awarded IRL?</p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Ask for Signups</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While it may seem a bit formal, asking people to sign up can help with attendance since it puts the responsibility on the members to commit to a time. This can also help dictate what you will do if you have too many or too few people for a particular activity.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How to Announce Your Event</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">So you’ve gotten this far and are ready to announce! what do you say? </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When announcing your event to your community make sure you are clear and concise and all the important information is easy to find.

While this may seem like a difficult task as long as you have clear rules for the rest of your community you can simply extend those to your events. It’s important to set clear expectations before your event and these can also be a part of your initial announcement.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You may need to create a special set of rules for your specific event. For example, a “No Spoilers” rule if you decide to watch a movie simultaneously or “No Spectating/Stream sniping” rule if you\'re playing a competitive game. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Special Situations</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In this section we’ll go over some situations that may happen and how to handle them.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Low or No Attendance</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The day of your event arrives, you’ve had an awesome announcement, have all of your channels ready and maybe only a few people show up. What do you do? </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">First, give yourself a pat on the back. You did the hardest thing anyone could do which is put yourself out there and set up a great event.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Next, ask your community for feedback. Maybe the date and time weren’t convenient, maybe they didn\'t like the activity you set up or it could be they forgot. Consider posting reminders to let everyone know when an upcoming event is coming up. Tell your community members to invite a friend to attend the next event- word of mouth is a great way to increase awareness.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Lastly, have fun! Even if you only have 3 people in attendance pretend you’re at Discordcon and everyone is invited! A small gathering of highly enthusiastic community members can be just as entertaining and worthwhile as a larger but more lackluster group gathering. By staying engaged yourself you’ll spread that positivity which others will also pick up on.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Emergencies</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Things happen that are out of your control, and that\'s ok. Depending on the size of your community, it may be beneficial to train and designate someone to take your place if you cannot host your event. This person can be someone from your moderation staff if they feel they’re up to the task or even a member of a designated event team!</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Change of Plans</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What if you’re ready and rearing to play your favorite obstacle course battle royale but your community want to play the hottest murder mystery space game? </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Depending on the size of your community and how close you are, there are different ways to approach this. For small groups, you’ll probably be fine with switching up your activities. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For larger groups you’ll probably have a fair amount of people who are attending for your specific activity which may upset those who took the time to attend. In this situation, make sure you acknowledge those who want to switch up the event and propose another day for the activity.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Hosting community events can be a lot of fun and can really bring your community together. Get to know your community and create an event that best caters to them for an optimal outcome. But remember- the aim is to have fun, create bonds, and foster a sense of belonging amongst one another! The result will be a community that\'s highly engaged, unified, and happy.</span></p>\\n<p><br><br></p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After you’ve enabled community features for your server, you can use Discord Insights to help you understand not just how your members are interacting with the server, but also what these people are like. In order to understand your members, you need to understand how to infer characteristics of their personality, behavior, and knowledge based on your community demographics and new member traffic sources. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Before reading this article, you should have a basic understanding of how to interpret the charts and tables in the server insights dashboard. A description of each is provided on the dashboard itself. A brief glossary of terms is provided at the end of this article for further clarification.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Understanding Your Members</span></h3>\\n<h4>Community Demographics</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The information most immediately available about your community is available on the Audience tab of Server Insights. This does </span><strong>not</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> include demographic information about all of the members on your server, but rather only members that have visited your server (i.e. viewed at least one channel) within the past 28 days. Therefore, this provides a snapshot of the nature of your </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">actual</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> community, including their country of origin, Discord account age, and the devices they use to access Discord. This information is useful in a variety of ways.</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Which countries are my members from?</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Knowing the countries your members are from will help you understand their language competency and cultural background. For example, if your members are generally from the U.S., you can expect that they mostly speak English as a first language. You can also expect that having a wide distribution of represented countries will result in members with different concepts of harassment, NSFW content, racism, or other topics all interacting with each other. </span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Are my members also new to Discord?</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> If your members are new to Discord (&lt; 1 day or &lt; 1 month), then they are less likely to be familiar with the app, bots, or other Discord functions compared to members that have older accounts. They may also not yet understand common Discord etiquette or be wholly versed in the Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>What devices do they use?</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Knowing how your members are accessing Discord let you know how members are viewing your server. The screen real estate and mobile app experience is different from the desktop experience. If you have a high percentage of mobile members, ensuring that your informational channels are short will help those members navigate your server more easily.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>How long have they been a member of the server?</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Veteran users may have different expectations and uses of the server compared to newer members. They may be more used to bots or other systems the server uses in operation and less accepting of change compared to new members. However, a low proportion of veteran users may indicate that the long term value of your server is low and that people do not see a reason to stay. </span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Traffic Sources</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once you’ve looked at your user demographics, you should start to analyze your traffic sources, </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">especially</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> if your user demographics are different from what you expected. The Audience insights will help you understand the composition of your community, but analyzing your member growth will help you understand how you got there.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The first thing to look at is the new members chart on the Growth &amp; Activation tab. This illustrates your member joins over time by source, including Server Discovery, vanity URL, and regular Discord invite.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Invite Statistics</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While the vanity URL for your server is easy to remember, it still functions just like a normal invite. You can find out more about the way your invites are driving traffic to your server by scrolling down to the Most Popular Invites and Most Popular Referrers tables.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Most Popular Referrers table shows the website that your members were on just before they clicked your invite link. For websites that support this functionality, this is a great way to understand what web pages are driving traffic to your server regardless of how many invite links you have. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Most Popular Invites table shows you which server invites are being used the most (and also includes your vanity URL, if you have one). If you are using only a single invite to your server, then this table is not informative. However, one way to make this table more useful is to generate multiple invite links to your server. Then you can use a unique invite link each place you currently use the same invite link and will better be able to see which websites are generating the most traffic.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once you set up unique invite links, you can measure not just the number of members that come from a website but the extent to which that website’s invite link is shared. For example, if 100 people join from an invite link on Twitter, you could expect to see 100 invite uses and 100 referrals from twitter.com. However, one of those users may send that same invite link through other methods to 20 more users. In this case, the invite link will show 120 uses, but widely different referrals related to those 20 additional members. In the end though, you can still easily attribute those joins to Twitter and better understand your traffic sources as a result. </span><strong>However, you should remember that any adjustments you make to your invite system will take some time to reflect meaningfully in your server insights</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Relating Traffic Sources to User Behavior</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now that you have detailed information about how members are arriving at your server, you can start analyzing how this is impacting your community characteristics. You can also start drawing conclusions about how users might behave in terms of contribution to discussion, adherence to server rules, and longevity as a member.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, members that join via an invite link found on social media, such as a Facebook group/page, subreddit, or Twitter may already have prior experience in your server’s topic.  Having previously been invested in your topic/community, they may be more well behaved and more likely to stay compared to other members.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The behavior of members joining from another Discord server will vary. If the server in question is directly related to your topic, such as the official Discord server for the game that your Discord server is about, you will likely get members that are interested in staying on your server long-term. If the rules of the related server are similar to your own, then these members will probably be able to follow the rules of your server without issue. However, if your rules are very different from the other server, there may be a “culture clash” from new members that aren’t used to your rules.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The types of members that join from a third party server listing site or Server Discovery can vary wildly depending on the server listing site itself and how you advertise your server. Members that join via Server Discovery or third party server listing sites often don’t know exactly what they are looking for and may not be invested in your topic before joining. They may also just be browsing for servers that they can troll or raid, and might not be as likely to stay compared to members that have more personal interest in your topic or server.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You should also consider the way that people from these various sources will interact with each other. If an overwhelming number of your users is coming from one source, those people may create a server culture that is not welcoming to members that come from other places. As a server owner, you will have to carefully consider how to manage potential conflicts that arise.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Overall though, remember that these examples are still based on deductive reasoning and may not be applicable to your server, even if the origin of your server traffic is the same. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Having read this article, you should better understand how to connect the information from the Audience tab of your server insights with information about your traffic sources from the Growth &amp; Activation tab.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">However, any conclusions you draw from this data assume your new members and old members are similar, or that most of your visitors within the past 28 days are either longtime members or new members as seen in the relevant chart. If you have recently changed the way you advertise your server dramatically, the origin and demographics of your members may also be changing. If this is the case, you will need to consider the possibility that your community is changing, or that two or more communities are developing alongside each other. </span><strong>It is vitally important that you understand the nature of your members and your traffic sources before attempting to deduce the relationships between them.</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When you can relate traffic sources and demographics towards user behavior, you give yourself a strong, data-driven foundation for future improvements to your community that will reflect in server insights. Measuring the demographic characteristics of your community and how they arrived at your server is the foundation towards managing your community well.

Take a moment to understand what each of those terms mean before continuing with the rest of this article. For more information, check out the definitions on the Insights portal itself.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Visitors</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Members that click on your server and view at least one channel are counted as “visiting” your server or channel. Any user that joins your server is automatically a visitor on the day that they joined. Members that join a voice channel are referred to as </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Listeners</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. On the table of channel activity, these people are described as </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Readers</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Communicators</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Members that have sent at least one message in a text channel or spoken for at least one second in a voice channel. All communicators are also visitors. On the table of channel activity, these people are called </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Chatters</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>User Activation</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Discord defines a user as being ‘activated’ when they send at least one message or view at least three channels.</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> </span></p>\\n<p><strong>Retention</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - In general, retention refers to the continued use of a product or service over time. Members do not need to send a message in order to count as being retained as long as they view at least one channel. For example, a user that visits your server one month after joining has been “retained” for a month.</span></p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">⚠️ Content Warning: This article contains mentions of adult topics that may not be appropriate for younger readers. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some Preliminaries</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are millions of communities on Discord with varying interests and diversities. As such, there might be a desire for some servers to be able to integrate adult content as part of their community discussions. This would be the kind of content that is suitable for some people based on age restriction yet unsuitable for others. Channels for this content can provide an important space for adults in your server to discuss issues related to topics such as sexual health, safe sex, their relationships with their bodies, or a space to share and explore adult content. Adult content in any medium cannot be shared on Discord outside of channels that have been marked with the NSFW toggle. Maintaining such a space in any community does require a significant amount of oversight, effort, and proactive zeal from any given moderation team. As such, keep in mind that choosing to create this space is purely optional and most communities are free to decide whether having such a space is suitable for the culture and if it fits within the context of their community. This article will cover what falls under the umbrella of adult content, what it means, when and where it is allowed, how to maintain a space for it, and how to successfully set up and moderate such a space in compliance with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What is Adult Content?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Adult content is anything that would be unsuitable for those under the age of 18 to view. This is synonymous with the term “NSFW” for the purposes of this article. NSFW is an acronym for the statement “not safe for work”, which is used as a shorthand to clearly indicate to others that a certain type of content may not be appropriate to look at in public, professional or controlled environments.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For Parents, Guardians and Educators</span></h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you wish to allow teens in your care to be in communities that might have an adult channel but you do not want them to see it, familiarize them with the age gate screen and what it means. Set up the teen’s account with them and ensure you provide their real date of birth so that they cannot pass the age gate on channels containing adult content.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The most effective way of limiting the chances that your teen runs into any NSFW content would be to only allow them to join servers that do not contain channels that allow adult content. A good place to start would be to look towards Partnered Servers. Servers that are officially partnered with Discord (partnered servers) do not allow any explicit adult content. You can review the channels of the server that they are joining and peruse the rules of the server. Channels with the NSFW toggle marked on will have this <img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/1500000192841/image_2020-12-07_231923.png\\" alt=\\"image_2020-12-07_231923.png\\" width=\\"37\\" height=\\"30\\"> warning symbol on top of the pound sign next to the channel name. </span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Familiarize yourself with the private messaging system in Discord as well as the explicit media filter setting in the </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">User Settings</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> &gt; </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Privacy and Safety. </span></em>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Please note that sending explicit content to users without consent and to children can be reported to </span><strong>Discord Trust and Safety. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You read more on how to properly report things <a href=\\"https://support.Discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000291932-How-to-Properly-Report-Issues-to-Trust-Safety\\" target=\\"_self\\">here</a>.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Please feel free to browse more on how Discord tackles safety on its platform in this section of the website. Check out our <a href=\\"https://Discord.com/safety\\" target=\\"_self\\">Safety Portal</a></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, particularly in the Parents and Educators section for further guidance.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Age Gating</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The first step to setting up an adult content channel is to determine what method of age gating you need and how you want to set it up. People who should not have access to the content will try to get in and what steps you take to keep them out is up to you. Please note, since things like server icons, invite splashes, server banners, user profile pictures, usernames, nicknames, and custom statuses cannot be age gated, they should not contain any adult content. Emojis containing adult content should only be hosted and posted in places that are age gated. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord only requires that you use the NSFW toggle, but depending on your server and the nature of the content shared, you may want to take a more active approach to ensuring the content is only accessed by adults. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">NSFW Toggle</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The NSFW toggle must be turned on for any channels with NSFW content. Even if your server is exclusively 18+ and requires users to send a picture of their photo ID to join, the channel still needs this toggled on. In addition to keeping minors out of spaces with adult content, this toggle will also flag the channel as NSFW so that adult users can avoid it if they do not wish to see that content. Not marking NSFW channels appropriately opens the risk of action being taken on the server from Discord’s Trust and Safety Team. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord asks all users to submit their birthday upon account creation and has been asking users whose accounts were made prior to its rollout to provide their birthday upon attempting to open an NSFW channel. This will prevent users who have told Discord that they are under the age of 18 from seeing any content in the channel, they will instead be met with a page telling them that they are not old enough to view the channel. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Server Gating</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you run a server with NSFW content, you may want to consider preventing users from just joining and immediately opening NSFW channels. Whether you want to do this or not depends on you and what your channels are for.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If your main concern is to do your due diligence to abide by the Terms of Service and Community Guidelines for a server with some image only channels, you may not want to gate your server entirely. If your main concern is keeping your younger members safe from engaging in inappropriate discussions and your adult members safe from unknowingly interacting with minors in an inappropriate way, then you might want to set up additional levels of security to keep out any minors who may have given the incorrect age when prompted by Discord’s age gate.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This can be achieved by asking users how old they are as part of your onboarding process. Perhaps a user must supply their age in their introduction or through picking a role from a bot. Users who aren’t aware that there is NSFW content in your server that they may later want access to are less likely to pretend to be over 18 immediately upon joining. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It should be noted that this is less effective if your server is named something that makes it obvious that the server contains 18+ content because users who join will likely know that they will need to lie to access it.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channel Role Gating</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If your server has certain channels designated for adult content and the server has minors in it that are there to access age appropriate content that’s also hosted in the server, it may be worth role locking the adult content channels.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This can be implemented by making it so that @everyone, a role all members have, or an under 18 role, is unable to see the channel. The main ways to do this would be to set the default permissions for the channel to neutral and set another role to deny access, or set the default user permissions to deny access and the over 18 role to grant access. This also allows you to later remove access to adult content from any users that are causing problems in the channel by simply removing the role that grants them access.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are various ways that role permissions can be set up to prevent access to a channel. This is only an example, and is not the only option, and may not be the best option to go along with your overall server permissions setup.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channel role gating can also allow you an extra opportunity to read the rules for or regarding the adult content channels. This can be accomplished by asking users to react to a message within the rules, dm a secret phrase in the rules to a bot that assigns a role, ask a staff member directly for the role and have that staff member ask the user to confirm they’ve read the rules before assigning it, or a number of other systems. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channel Name and Permissions</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When users open the channel in question, they will see the channel name and see the popup in the screenshot below. Most users will probably not read any channel rules or channel description beyond this. It is important to clearly state what the channel is for in the channel name to prevent users from just assuming it’s a general media channel based on Discord’s popup and the channel name.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, if you have a channel that is used for text-based advice about an adult topic and the channel name is vague and has image permissions enabled, users may assume that the channel is for posting content and not for seeking advice/discussing a heavy topic. To make things clearer, try to match the channel name and permissions to the purpose and context of the channel. In this case, changing the channel name to #&lt;topic&gt;-advice and disabling image permissions may help users to better understand what the channel is intended to be used for.

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You are a moderator of a community on Reddit, and are thinking about starting a Discord server along with it. This article will help you determine whether your community will benefit from a Discord server or not. If you find the answer to be yes, then you’ll also find a few tips that’ll guide you through launching and maintaining a healthy community on Discord that’ll serve as a meaningful extension of your existing subreddit.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Does Your Subreddit Need a Discord?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord communities are distinct from subreddits and attract different audiences. While there are often overlaps between those audiences, it will not always be the case, and it’s important to determine whether your community will benefit from having a Discord before you attempt to start one. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Successful Discord communities revolve around human connections and conversations and not just </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">content</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. For a Reddit community to translate well into a Discord community, it should be centered around a topic its members are passionate about and are highly engaged with. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To start, ask yourself the following questions:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Can there be in-depth discussions around the topic of your community that will benefit from a real-time chat setting?</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> For subreddits mainly focused around content without an avenue for discussion, the answer is usually no. Examples could include /r/aww and /r/eyebleach.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Does your subreddit have a large amount of retained users that visit it directly on a regular basis?</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Reaching the members of your Reddit community is often challenging, and requires them to go out of their way and take the first step and move to a different platform. If your community sees very sharp declines in traffic when no trending posts are present, it might indicate that most of your members “follow and forget” - only visit your community when it pops up on their home feed, which often indicates they will not be willing to follow you to Discord. </span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Are there other benefits relevant to your community that having a Discord could provide?</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Examples include LFG (helping players find groups) in video game subreddits, the ability to host events such as game nights for community engagement, and topics that include lengthy back-and-forth conversations that are more suited for a real time chat environment rather than threaded long-form conversations (such as providing a space for personalized help around topics like programming, tech support, or mental health). </span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you believe the answers to those questions would be negative about your community, it might be helpful to take a step back and reconsider whether a Discord server would benefit it. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderation Teams </span></h3>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Starting a Moderator Team</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Typically, it’s best to keep the Reddit and Discord moderation teams separate. Your Discord is a separate ecosystem with its own needs - and it’s important to find users from within it that will help you develop and maintain it, and make it flourish. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When starting off, adding your existing subreddit moderator team usually works. However, it’s important to note that those mods might not always be as dedicated to this new platform as they are to the one that they came from. Looking into the future for your Discord server, things might change and the subreddit mods that helped it in the early days might end up having to take a backseat in favor of users who are brought in from within the server. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Server Owner and Administrators</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The owner of the server should be a dedicated mod from the subreddit who knows both the community and the inner-workings of Discord. Decisions made by the owner will be critical to the development of your server, so take a moment to review all of the potential candidates within your team to choose the best one for the task.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Make sure to bring in at least one user or subreddit mod who is also as knowledgeable with the Discord ecosystem and familiar with your existing community to help with the setup and administration of the server early on.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Reddit and Discord Moderator Teams Coexisting </span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You now have a bunch of mods! Mods on your subreddit, mods dedicated to your Discord server, and mods that are both. But what do you do with all these mods, how do you tell them apart, what perms should they have? </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Communication between your different teams is key to the success of both of your communities.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Outside of the owner, you should ideally have at least two other moderators that are present on both teams. These shared mods will be able to efficiently relay information between the teams, coordinate collaborations between the Reddit and Discord communities, be able to take action in emergency situations, and mediate conflicts if they occur.  </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Here are a few best practices:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Make a private channel where your subreddit mods will be able to chat privately with your Discord team. It can be used primarily as an off-topic chat, while also being available for use as a liaison for your team to discuss cross-platform issues if and when they arise. </span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Give the subreddit moderators a special role. This will show the association of your server with the subreddit to your members.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Avoid giving subreddit moderators moderation privileges within your server, unless they’re interested in becoming moderators within your Discord as well - and are ready to accept the additional responsibilities and time commitments that come with the role. </span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As your subreddit moderators are still trusted contributors, you may grant them privileges that might be gated off for regular users by default, such as link embeds and file upload permissions.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It’s important to be upfront to your community about the fact that your subreddit and Discord server are run and moderated by completely separate mod teams after the server starts taking shape. Set up escalation paths for both of your teams to direct issues related to your subreddit to Reddit modmail, and vice-versa, direct users experiencing issues within the server to its team.  </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">All staff positions (except the owner and lead admins) should be independent of the user’s status on different moderation teams, and you should remind your staff team that it is not a given to be modded elsewhere if you become a mod on either platform. Mods that participate in multiple teams must still uphold your activity requirements, and meet all of your expectations similarly to the rest of your team.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Hosting Events and Cross Promotions</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While your communities are linked together, they’re separate entities with different groups of regular visitors and contributors. When considering cross platform promotions, assess their relevance to each of your audiences, and determine whether they will find it helpful. A few best practices around this topic are:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Avoid cross-promoting micro events within one of your community’s platforms, such as announcing a specific discussion thread on Reddit to your Discord members, when it does not provide them value that can’t be achieved otherwise. Focus on platform-specific events that your users will be able to participate in locally.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For major events that are relevant to all of the sub-communities you operate, try to include a space for participation in each one of them. However, it is also a good idea to provide information or links to the other event pages/channels on every platform. This makes it easy for people to browse the discussions on each platform and easily join in on multiple conversations in different places if they’re willing to.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Avoid promoting platform-specific announcements on other platforms. For example, don’t link your moderator application form for Discord on your subreddit, and vice versa. </span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Closing notes</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Creating a Discord server can be a great way to broaden your subreddit-based community\'s horizons, giving your users a whole new way to interact with each other. However, it\'s important to remember that maintaining a Discord community can be a whole lot of work that some of your existing team members might not be interested in taking. Finding the right person to lead your Discord and ensuring your community\'s new outpost is in good hands early on will ensure a lasting and smooth relationship between your subreddit and Discord, to everyone’s benefit.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">With Discord\'s ease of use and popularity, along with the declined use of platforms like forums or IRC, many communities are looking to migrate to Discord. While most of it depends on your specific community, we aim to give some general advice, gotchas, and tips to make it as pain-free as possible. While this guide is meant to give advice, every community is different and you should consider the particulars of your community before deciding to make the leap. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This guide assumes that you’ve already learned how to set up a server and create basic roles and permissions. If you need a primer on those, take a look at </span><a href=\\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-How-do-I-set-up-permissions-\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Basic Permissions</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and </span><a href=\\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Setting Up Roles</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Why Are You Moving?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Let’s start with the best question: why are you moving to Discord? Sometimes, the easiest answer is the most obvious answer. Maybe you’re looking for a better platform to support your community, a better system in organizing your community, or just boosting activity on a dead platform. Communities that solely exist around platforms like IRC and forums tend to have some issues that can’t be solved by fixing the platform: IRC is less actively used and forums can be complicated and take a while to navigate properly. Because of these inherent platform issues, Discord makes a substantial effort to fix these issues. Giving your users a better place to chat and interact revives a lot of dying communities.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Informing Your Users</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Every community has “that guy”. You know that guy. The one who refuses to let go and chooses not to move platforms because they already have a rhythm. A flow. Daring to mess with that workflow, they’ll stop at nothing to make sure they can continue to use the things they currently use. What’s the best way to handle users like this? Well, let’s start with the users who </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">don’t</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> have that problem.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Announcements</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Every platform has a way to do this, and it’s usually the most effective. Particularly for those who still actively check the platform from time to time. Making a simple system announcement “We’ve moved!” can get you a large chunk of users in no-time. Fortunately, Discord’s new user onboarding process also makes joining Discord simple, since they only need the invite for the server, and the app walks them through setting up an account during the join. (But you probably already knew that as a seasoned Discord user!)</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Announcements should be pretty informative to users. A simple “We’ve moved!” could suffice, but giving your users a reason to why or info on what Discord is can be the best tool in your announcement. Being candid and transparent can go a long way with your users. You can start off with a “You might have noticed a lack of activity here…” or “We’re hoping to rejuvenate the community again!”. As long as you provide a little information on the move and its significance, many users will be willing to join a new platform.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Redirecting Users From Your Old Domain</span></h4>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360101290613/image_2020-12-07_233139.png\\" alt=\\"image_2020-12-07_233139.png\\"></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Alright, so you’ve got the transition started, but what about new users looking for your community? Make sure you start redirecting them! Update any of your social media, website links, or domain links to the Discord server with a permanent invite. For better tracking, you can even set up multiple server invites to go to specific places.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You can even embed a preview of your server in your web page, or you can redirect entirely to the discord invite and let it open in the web chat. If your community has a website as well, you can enable the Discord Widget in the server settings to display on your website (Server Settings &gt; Widget). This is a great tool to show how active your community is on the Discord server, and jump right to it from the widget. A little caution here: website crawlers </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">love</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> to find these and drop bot accounts in for raiding, so it may be a good idea to up your security in the server, or look to an advanced article on handling raids.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\\"><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360099060154/image_2020-12-07_233426.png\\" alt=\\"image_2020-12-07_233426.png\\"></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Promoting Your Discord Server</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While your existing user base might be enough to jump start your server, you might want to look into different forms of advertising it to keep growing your community</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are plenty of Discord server lists, even lists of lists! If you meet the requirements you can also make your server discoverable and let the users join from other discord, but one of the most effective ways to get new users is word of mouth from your current ones. This also ensures that incoming members have at least a few things in common with your already existing population. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To help with that, put your invite link in the first channel users see, at the bottom. Make sure new users have a good experience and don’t get lost.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Adapting Your Community to Discord</span></h3>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Opt-In/Opt-Out Channels</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Part of the beauty in Discord is that you can build an organized server that meets the needs of all of your members that can be customized using a few built in tools and a bot or two in a server. Users coming from a forum or IRC background are used to being forced into viewing everything available to them. This can be overwhelming and can lead to users leaving large parts of that platform unread. Giving the users the power to opt into channels and opt out of them makes it possible to give your users a better, more concise platform to message on.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Opting out is an easy thing to do and usually best in smaller servers with fewer channels. Users can opt out by muting a channel client-side. This will dim the channel and prevent them from seeing new messages, but they can be notified </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">via pings (like roles, a direct ping, or even an </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">@everyone</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">). While this is usually fine for the user, in larger servers with multiple channels, it can be painful to go through individually muting channels/categories. The downside to this, though, is that users are still subjected to unwanted pings, particularly when they are coming from a format like forums, where they can check new posts at their leisure.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Opting in to channels is a bit more complicated and requires some additional setup, but can be very beneficial to your members who maybe participate in select areas of your server. You can “role-lock” channels and categories so that users with specific roles can view the channels. When a member doesn’t have permission to view those channels, they also no longer receive any pings from it! The downside to this is setting up a system to either automate them receiving roles, or manually assigning users. Using a bot can extend the automation to have users run a command, or react to a specific message to gain roles. This allows your members to customize their experience and enjoy your server the way they want to.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">From IRC</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The two clearest advantages while moving from IRC to Discord is how you can separate topics into different channels, and the moderation tools</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Separating topics into different channels allows you to specialize instead of having a messy chat where six conversations are going on at once. It also lets you set different permissions for different users in different channels. For example, you might want to have a support channel where support staff can manage messages, but don’t give them that permission to other channels</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The moderation tools are also much more robust, allowing you for example to delete messages, change usernames, or even set slow modes in specific channels. The support for moderators that Discord provides is on the whole, more comprehensive than private IRC networks can give, with a lot of great resources and reporting tools. Discord is usually more stable too, without netsplits or other fun events.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/1500000193421/image_2020-12-07_233509.png\\" alt=\\"image_2020-12-07_233509.png\\" width=\\"541\\" height=\\"480\\"></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To ease the migration, there are plenty of bots that allow you to bridge IRC and Discord, with some limitations like not showing embeds and showing deleted messages.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As a last advantage, and the reason why many servers migrate, Discord is more user friendly than IRC, which requires knowing a web client (that might even be banned in your channel like kiwiirc) or downloading a IRC client. It also exposes your users IP address and OS version (with CTCP commands) which can cause some privacy issues.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">From Forums</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The main problem while moving to Discord is having to adapt to “real-time” conversations. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It means you probably will need more mods, and for them to be more active. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, forums servers’s staff usually have a lot of issues early on due to the increased need for moderation as its happening vs deleting and handling reports on their own time.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the biggest things to keep in mind is that if your moderators engage with the community like regular users, their job will get far easier. After all, if you build that trust and rapport with your community members it makes keeping the community safe for them that much easier.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When setting up a server, it may be best to follow the structure of your currently established forum until the need arises to make slight alterations to adapt members, particularly those that may be joining without ever having interacted with your forums previously. Structuring it to the same as your forum allows users to feel “at home” with where they were previously. Including a channel for feedback on the server will also help you ingest feedback on the structure or organization of your server and address any missing channels that may be needed.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Bots</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While moving to Discord, you might need to port your current bots and find new ones. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Compared to platforms like IRC, Discord bots have the potential to be more feature rich. You can create custom embeds, set permissions, delete messages, even react to emojis. Bots can also provide an authentication link between other locations, like a forum.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You might find it far easier to develop for Discord than from IRC, due to the great frameworks that have been developed over the years, and way easier than forums where you don’t need to write one from scratch for your specific forums layout. You can also find a lot of bots that already do what you need.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The basic things that you should look at while selecting a bot is making sure that bots only have the permissions they need, and that they are verified (or you host it yourself). One of the most important bots you can have is those that help you with auto-moderation.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderation Levels</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the decisions you have to make early on is what level of moderation you want Discord to apply. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example: some servers might want the new user experience to be as quick as possible(for cases where they get linked externally a lot, or a support server). Other servers with more established communities might want to up that moderation level and require things like verified phone numbers + being in the server for 10 minutes to avoid raids and spammers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the most important things to keep a look at is the new user experience. What does the server look like to a new account just joining it? Do they have a clear path to your rules? To other channels? How hard is it to ask questions if they get lost?</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Finding New Staff</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moving your community also means moving your staff. This can be challenging as it requires getting used to new policies and new tools. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example: if your community is coming from a forum, you might need extra moderators to have real-time coverage of chat. If you are coming from IRC you might need to adapt your guidelines to use mutes instead of just kick and bans, along with the ability to delete messages.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Roles and permissions might look completely different than you might be used to. For example: some servers migrated their current mod team and structure, then added an extra role for “Chat moderators” who specialized in Discord. Other servers find completely new staff and then give honorary roles to the previous staff. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It may be necessary to work with your current team of moderators on your platform to discuss the roles and responsibilities of the team even before you make the move. Are they comfortable moderating both locations during transition? Are they ready to learn moderation on a new platform? Do they want to continue moderating for the community? It’s a good idea to get these details ironed out ahead of time so that you can plan for needing additional moderators.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you don’t have staff with previous experience moderating Discord servers, it might make more sense to get external help, preferably from your own community. These community members would ideally be well versed in Discord and preferably comfortable with moderating on Discord. They can guide you through adapting policies, making new roles, setting the permissions correctly, using channels and sections and giving you useful links to other servers where you can ask questions or report users.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We know migrating your community is a huge task and each one has completely different issues. A well executed migration can help reinvigorate your community and facilitate new activity and membership; a rushed one can split your community base and irritate existing users.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We hope that the tips in this article help make the migration smoother for you and your community. As a closing note, don’t forget to talk and discuss the migration with your community (not just your mods), plan it ahead of time in a transparent way, make sure everyone is onboard, and take care to avoid alienating anyone, being flexible with the plan if need be. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>"')

If you DAR messages, you should also be sure to complete a full report using the form below.

In fact, the message will be saved as soon as you begin the process of filling out the IAR form, so another moderator can delete the message while you are filling out the report! The right click menu and 3 dot menu options for IAR, and the IAR modal itself can be seen below. Keep in mind however, to use IAR in a server, the server must first have 50 or more members.

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Let’s say it’s been just a little over three months since you started moderating a server and things are going really well in your eyes. You’re working diligently on a team with other staff members to help you with the day-to-day moderation tasks that a server demands. You’re feeling really good about your activity levels and direction of the server until today, when two other members of staff have all decided to step down due to not enjoying moderation anymore. You’re confused and frustrated- things seemed to be okay, great even. What’s changed? </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderator Burnout: What is it?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Starting a new job or position or activity will always be exciting. Most moderators are eager to help a community that they love and that they are an active part of to grow and prosper. You spend a lot of time there already, so why would you </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">not </span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">want to do your part in helping that community be successful? However as time passes, interests can change and initial enthusiasm can wane. As a moderator, you might find yourself spending time in other communities or you realize your real world schooling and work is a priority over moderating, so there is the potential for anxiety to build as you try to juggle all of your responsibilities. Maybe your mental health is being affected by spending many hours a day on the internet, dealing with trolls and people who simply just want to cause trouble. This can mentally drain you, having to deal with negativity and conflict day in and day out. When moderating begins to feel like a chore, as opposed to a hobby, that’s when you might feel like moderator burnout has set in.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Burnout is the emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion you feel after a prolonged period of stress brought on by certain activities. Spending too much time in a stressful environment can easily lead to feelings of exhaustion, feeling distant from the activity or task at hand, or simply just having negative feelings when thinking about doing the activity or task. These negative effects on your body and mind eat away at you until you feel like you are at your limit and just do not have enough energy and motivation in you anymore to continue moderating. Sometimes burnout makes it feel like the only thing that can make you happy is to stop being a moderator completely.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Signs of Moderator Burnout</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the most common signs of moderator burnout is when you have been noticing yourself being less and less active when it comes to moderating, as well as being less active in the server itself. As a moderator, you have begun to feel like it is a chore for you to be moderating the server; something you feel forced to do, knowing it needs to be done with no joy attached to the task at hand. Time seems to move so slowly when you are moderating as you are constantly checking the clock, just hoping that an hour of your time is enough on the server. Your time spent on your server becomes less and less as the days go by until you have either stepped down or completely withdrawn from any activity in the server, moderation or otherwise.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A burgeoning lack of participation is another sign. If you know yourself well enough, you can probably tell when something is bothering you. Perhaps on any normal given day, you are social and engage with your other team members as well as with regular server members, but recently you’re only chatting in public channels, giving out the occasional public warning. You notice that you only really check the staff channels when there is a ping. Your account may be in the server and your name on the member list, but you’re no longer an active community member. At this point burnout has set in. There may be the urge to come in every day and give 100% but then you run the risk of giving too much, too quickly. You start to dread the amount of work necessary to do your part and eventually start to taper off.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You might notice yourself making more mistakes than normal. Frustration is another part of burnout that can affect the mental aspects of moderating. Feeling like you are making too many mistakes or are not doing as much as another moderator is a hard thing to put a reason to. Feelings of inadequacy may lead to reprimanding yourself internally, being your own worst critic, finding yourself in a rut, thinking everyone in the server is being difficult. You know you are making mistakes, others on your team see it, thinking they are helping by giving you constructive criticism. There is a lack of accomplishment that makes you frustrated, especially in moderating. Nothing you do feels like it is being done right, adding that to the difficulties of members of the server, and frustration kicks in. When telling members of the server to do something and they continue to post against the rules, you begin to wonder if you matter or are even making a difference.  </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Burnout can easily affect your attitude. Moderating tests your patience as some members of the server will purposefully push the line, seeing what they can get away with. As a new moderator, you might not be as strict, as you are wanting the community to not only respect you but to like you. As time passes, your patience may begin to run thin and you put up with a lot less while you get more irritated. You have a shift in your attitude and can become bitter at what you have to deal with when moderating a server. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Avoiding Moderator Burnout</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After taking time to look at the signs of moderator burnout, it is important to know how to avoid it so you and your team can find your groove again and remember what it feels like to enjoy being not only a moderator but a community member.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Everything is healthy with moderation, including, well, moderation. Knowing when you need breaks and encouraging yourself, as well as other moderators, to take these breaks can really help with mounting stress levels. Moderating takes a toll on your mental health, so being able to step away and catch your breath can really help reset your focus. Reach out to other members on your team that can help with moderator duties and shoulder the workload so those that are experiencing burnout can feel that it is okay to step away. A big part of working on a team is being honest with each other when things are good and when things are not so good. You may be surprised at how eager your team members are to help prop you up when you’re feeling low. Remember- you\'re not alone in this, so feel free to take those breaks and be assured that the server is not on fire and that there are eyes other than yours that are there to share the workload. Offline life and your overall health should always come before any aspect of online life.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Make sure you are not taking on too much, but also have enough to do. This can be a tricky balance. Depending on your moderation experience and skills, it can be hard to determine what your work load capabilities are, especially as offline life changes. Be upfront and honest with what your team expects from you, but also let them know that if you are feeling overwhelmed, that they can talk to you. Always have an open line of communication so you can find ways to help yourself, as well as the others you moderate with. Something that has worked on larger servers that you might be able to incorporate to your server is having a summary of the channels. With the summary, you can have moderators on your team sign up for which channels they enjoy moderating, as well as the others, and not feel like you have to be in too many channels at one time. Delegating work makes it seem more manageable and less daunting. Encourage yourself and your fellow moderators to try new channels after a couple weeks to change everyone’s scenery, as well allowing various team members the chance to interact with certain server members that might only hang out in channels that they don’t normally moderate. As a moderator, you might feel yourself wanting to do more and seek to add to your responsibilities. Suggesting community events and helping out organizing and running these events makes for a great change of pace to contrast the normal moderating duties of watching chat. Events are great for bringing regular members together with moderators. It is a fun task that can bring activity levels up and spread some excitement.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Create an environment that is fun to moderate in. Having or suggesting a staff channel where you and your fellow moderators can be yourselves or vent is a great way to relieve some stress and have your team get to know one another. Ask them questions every day to encourage discussion and communication between your entire team. Building a team that works well with one another helps with the communication between fellow moderators, so they can express how everyone is feeling, and seek advice on stresses in the community.  You can get to know each other’s personal lives and what other things in life might be causing outside stress. Getting to know each other’s personalities can help determine if someone might easily burn out or if they are just more introverted than other moderators on your team. Holding events, such as game nights, where you all play a game online together can really help you and other moderators feel at ease, bring enjoyment to everyone, and help everyone reset for the next day of moderating.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the biggest, and perhaps simplest, things you can do to help with moderator burnout is just being thankful. Typing the two little words of “thank you” can go a long way. As a moderator, you spend your free time helping the server, so let your fellow moderators know you appreciate that they chose this as their hobby. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To that end, positive </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">specific</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> feedback is one of the best ways to let someone know that they did a good job and what exactly it was that they did well. By being specific about what you’re thanking your moderator for, you’re letting them know that their hard work is recognized and valued and </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">seen</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. Recognize when they put in a lot of hours on the server and are here on a day-to-day basis. Finding ways to reward them, whether through gifting Nitro or a special recognition in the server, can be really fulfilling to them. It reassures them that they are an important part of the server and are making a difference when helping. Be gracious with your words and remind them that they are here with you. It starts a chain reaction and you will see moderators thanking other moderators for their hard work.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderator burnout can happen to anyone at any time. It is important to understand what it is and how you can help. Whether you are an owner, administrator, or another moderator, it is important to support your team and look for the signs of burnout so you can suggest ways that might help them in how they are feeling. Always have an open line of communication with your team that fosters honesty. Encourage them or yourself to step away when feeling stressed or overwhelmed, and thank each other for helping in the server. Servers are a lot harder to run when doing it alone; moderators that are excited to be there are an important part of making sure things operate smoothly.</span></p>\\n<p><br><br></p>"')

To maintain </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">activity, moderators can use a few different methods which generally can be separated into two groups: active and passive. Active methods are those which require the presence and active participation of a moderator. Passive methods, on the other hand, do not require a constant presence from an individual and are often automated by using bots. Keep in mind that even passive methods will require occasional maintenance from a moderator.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the more popular passive methods are XP systems. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">XP systems, otherwise known as experience or leveling systems, grant users experience points (XP) and levels based on their activity in a server. Their main purpose is to reward member activity in the community. These systems exist in the form of bots. Usually they are just one function of multi-purpose bots, but there are cases where the sole function of the bot is the leveling system. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The basic way these systems work is:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Granting experience.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> A certain number of XP points is rewarded per message in text chat. In the case of rewarding voice chat activity, they grant experience based on time spent talking in the voice chat.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Preventing spam.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Leveling systems have built-in cooldowns. This means that not every message sent will contribute towards gaining XP points. Only the messages sent after the cooldown expires will grant additional XP. </span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Leveling up.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> After a certain number of XP points is acquired, the user reaches a new level.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Granting roles.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> When a certain level is hit, the bot automatically assigns a role to the user.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">These four steps are only a simplification of the process, and there are many options to consider while using these systems. Depending on the bot you choose to use, you can get various options for configuration but there are several that are commonly available on most bots. Some of these options are:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>XP and level customization.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Changing the XP gain per message and cooldown will allow you to have better control over the system, as well as fine tune it towards the level of activity in your community. This can be extended to role based reward systems as well. It’s important to adjust the levels at which certain roles are acquired, as the roles need to be reachable in order for the reward to have a purpose. Keep in mind that not all bots will allow changing the cooldown or XP gain per message, but they will always allow for setting roles at a level of your choice.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>XP Awareness.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Being aware of the current XP a user possesses is also a valuable aspect of XP systems. The two ways to see these stats are through leaderboard and rank commands. Leaderboard commands typically show the current top 10 users based on their level or experience, while rank commands show this info for specific users. Usually, XP systems have built in announcement messages for level-ups to keep members posted about their level automatically, some even with a ping to the user in question. These notifications can be turned off.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Channel Control. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">XP gain can be disabled or enabled per channel. While helping prevent needless spam, it also allows you to remove XP gain in channels where spam-like activity is encouraged, such as channels with bots.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Manual XP Control. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The last two basic options are adding and removing XP manually. Adding XP is commonly used if XP is automatically removed upon leaving the server. This allows users who had to re-join to gain all their former XP back. Alternatively, manually adding XP could also be considered a reward for certain actions, while removing would be used for punishments. Finally, resetting XP could be used for all users when you have a cyclical leveling system, while resetting XP for users who have been banned or left allows you to prevent clutter on the leaderboard.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>No XP Roles.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> The No XP role allows you to completely block XP gain for any user who has this role. It can be used in two possible ways: </span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Use this role on obvious spammers.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Anyone who you can tell is attempting to abuse the system via spamming should be put under this role in order to further hinder meaningless activity. </span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Grant the role per request.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> In the case where your system does not grant permissions via leveling, users should be allowed to request this role. Not everyone likes being seen on a leaderboard or the sidebar.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Usage of XP Systems</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The main function of XP systems is to reward user activity. Their ability to passively lead users towards being active allows moderators to occasionally take a moment to step back from their usual activities of engaging with their community. The existence of a leaderboard appeals to the competitive nature of humans and pulls them to be more active. Rewards additionally add to this appeal. This is applicable in small, medium and some large communities.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Alternatively, XP systems can be used as a measure of security. By locking certain permissions behind levels, you can make sure that inactive and malicious users are prevented from committing certain offenses. This is mostly applicable in very large servers.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Both of these routes will require the utilization of roles. There are two main reasons for this:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When it comes to rewards, not all moderators are willing to invest money into their rewards. In those cases, roles are the simplest way to grant rewards within the community itself.</span></li>\\n<li><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When it comes to security, permissions are tied to roles, so using them is needed as they allow control over which permissions are granted to large groups of people.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Regulation of Activity</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As the goal of XP systems is to boost activity, it is important to note that they will also lure in users who believe any type of activity is acceptable. This is not the case. While the problem of spam is already resolved by the cooldown ability of most XP systems, there are still behavioral issues that need to be addressed. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Members need to be aware that rules still exist in the community and they cannot simply do as they please. It is important to moderate those who blatantly misbehave in order to level up. Other contributions to the community, which are not measured with activity in text or voice chat, should also be rewarded, such as artworks, stories, etc.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Furthermore, activity that comes from channels which encourage spam-like behavior, such as bot channels, should not count towards the total. For that reason, XP gain should be disabled in channels of that sort.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Types of XP Systems</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Knowing that we have the ability to reset the XP in the server, we can use this option to create different types of XP systems. We can divide XP systems into three different types: cyclical, permanent and combined.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Cyclical Systems</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Cyclical systems reset XP points in a regular cycle. Cycle duration should be set based on activity, though it is not advisable to use this system in communities with very low activity. The constant resets in the leaderboard allow new members to climb the charts quickly, but this only lets the system be used for rewards. It is common to give out special rewards to the most active users at the end of the cycle, such as custom roles for the duration of the following cycle, which encourages continued activity to retain their rewards. This also gives moderators the opportunity to post announcements regularly at the ends of cycles. The biggest downside of this system is that not all bots have the ability to also remove leveling roles when the cycle ends.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Permanent Systems</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Permanent systems do not reset at any point in time. Occasionally, users that are banned or have left are removed from the leaderboards. They give a good look into who the most active and dedicated users in the community are. Permanent systems can be used both for rewards and security. Their biggest downside is that they are not very friendly towards new members, especially in older communities.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Combined Systems</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Combined systems are a combination of cyclical and permanent systems. They usually require the usage of 2 separate bots to keep track of rankings on both leaderboards. They take the best aspects of both systems, meaning they can be used both for rewards, which would be connected to the cyclical system, and security, which would be connected to the permanent one. This also allows for the cyclical leaderboard to help involve new users more, while still giving good insight of who the most active members of all time are with the permanent one. The only big downside that remains is the issue of removing roles from a large number of members.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Negative Aspects</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As with any system, there are several negative aspects to consider when it comes to using XP systems. All of these should be taken into consideration before you make a decision on whether you want to use one. Some of the most commonly voiced concerns would be the following:</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Spam</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The fact that these systems encourage sending a larger number of messages automatically leads to the idea of spam. Since spam is considered a violation of rules, as well as a ToS violation, this would become a huge problem. The issue is easily resolvable, thanks to the built in anti-spam measures XP systems have, primarily the message cooldown. This, in combination with good moderation would make it certain that no spam is generated by the presence of the system.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Role Bloating</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Since most XP systems require utilization of roles for truly fulfilling their usage, the issue of role bloating comes to mind. It is important to manage and space the leveled roles properly in order to avoid creating an excessive number of roles with no real use in your server.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Low Quality content</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is believed that when it comes to rewarding members, rewards should be granted manually through qualitative judgement of content, rather than quantitative. It’s a fact that bots cannot themselves tell the quality of the messages sent. The fact that all types of conversations allow users to gain XP means that there is no meter on what the quality of the conversation is. Granting privileges as a result of such conversations sends the wrong idea of what sort of activity is encouraged. Only humans can truly judge content subjectively to determine quality. By combining proper moderation, for handling the judgement of quality, and the built-in preventive mechanisms of XP systems for quantity control, this issue can be held down to a minimal level.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Inorganic Communication</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This would be one of the most difficult problems of the system to resolve. Many members, with the intent of increasing their XP count and level, will attempt to hold conversation in the community. This part of it is perfectly fine. The problem arises when they start forcing conversation at any point in time solely to increase their message count. The result would be communication that is completely unnatural and unhealthy. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This type of abuse of the system can’t really be stopped with the cooldown system since most of the time it is not spam. The only real way to prevent this is to use the No XP role, but the difficulty of telling organic and inorganic communication apart raises the question: Was there really any violation of the system?</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Difficulty with Community Integration</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Not in every case is an XP system useful for a community. In many cases moderators can’t figure out how they can add this sort of system and make it seem like a natural part of the server, or how it can fit the theme of the community. Considering the theme and purpose of your server is an important part of making the decision of adding a leveling system to your server. Before you make the decision, ask yourself: </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How can I make this system a natural part of my community?</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Which Bot Do I Use?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In the following section, several publicly available bots will be presented as options for what you can use for an XP System in your server. The following bots have been chosen based on data collected from a survey of various moderators, administrators and owners in Discord communities. </span></p>\\n<p><strong>This list is not exhaustive.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> There are plenty of alternatives available online. All of the listed bots are free and public. Some features may be limited to paid additions or private versions of the bots. The content of this article is not endorsed by any bot or company related to the bots.</span></p>\\n<h4><a href=\\"https://gaiusbot.me/play/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Gaius Play</span></a></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Gaius Play is an entertainment bot that also hosts an XP system. It takes both text and voice chat activity into account. The basic version comes with a preset configuration for XP gain and leveling, as well as commands for adding rewards up to 6 roles, fully customizing and toggling level-up messages, manually controlling XP, ignoring activity in certain channels and the ability to boost XP gain within certain parameters (roles, channels, time periods). It also has the ability to remove leveled roles from all users, making it ideal for use in a cyclical system. Additionally, there are several premium features, such as unlimited reward roles and a tree leveling system. Users can also reset their own reward roles in order to change paths on the tree leveling system.</span></p>\\n<h4><a href=\\"https://amaribot.com/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">AmariBot</span></a></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Amari is a bot that is solely focused on leveling systems. It only looks at activity in text channels. This is a very simple bot, containing commands for setting rewards, manually controlling XP, customizing and toggling level-up messages, as well as ignoring activity in some channels. It has the ability to have 2 leaderboards active at the same time, both of which can be reset at any point. Donor features allow for modification of the cooldown between messages, as well as modification of the XP gain per message.</span></p>\\n<h4><a href=\\"https://nadeko.bot/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Nadeko</span></a></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Nadeko is a multi-purpose bot with a leveling system module. It detects activity exclusively from text chat and has a preset configuration for XP gain. It contains commands for setting up reward roles, toggling level-up messages, ignoring activity in channels and manually controlling XP. A big upside of this bot is that you have the option to host it yourself. This also adds the ability to set up in-bot currency rewards, as well as better overall control of the bot.</span></p>\\n<h4><a href=\\"https://tatsu.gg/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Tatsu</span></a></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Tatsu is another multi-purpose bot with an XP system module. It has several basic commands, allowing creation of reward roles, toggling level-up announcements, modifying XP gain per message and cooldown, manual XP control and ignoring channel activity. It also features a dashboard and a global leaderboard alongside the local one.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">With the available selection of bots and documentation explaining the setup of XP systems, using leveling modules is simpler than ever. The configuration options that exist on these modules allow for creative usage of leveling systems with the goal of passively increasing activity within the community.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Naturally, you have to consider several factors prior to deciding on using XP systems. If you are considering using one, think of how you can best integrate it into your community. In which way will you use it? Which type of system would suit your community best? Which bot would be the best for the task? Of course, there are negative aspects to consider as well, meaning you’d have to figure out how to control and minimize them. Carefully weigh all the pros and cons prior to making a final decision.</span></p>\\n<p><br><br></p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Transparency in moderation is the idea that moderator actions and the reasons for those actions should be made publicly visible and clear to the users of the server. Without transparency, users may have difficulty understanding how server rules are enforced and may also find it difficult to trust that the moderation team has their best interests at heart. However, too much transparency may lead to users testing the limits of the rules or harass others, both users and moderators, for their actions. Therefore, balancing the need for users to understand the thought process and actions of moderators with the need to ensure a reasonable level of privacy for each user and deter harassment is vital to a successful moderation system.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Pros and Cons of Transparency</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While there are certain “best practices” when it comes to moderation transparency, there is no single system that is right for everyone. The amount of transparency you need for your moderation system ultimately depends on your server rules, culture, and vision. This article will explain the pros and cons of transparency and ways that you can apply transparency to your moderation system.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Though the idea of moderation transparency is generally considered to be a good thing, it is important to understand that there are both pros and cons to transparency in moderation. Some of these pros and cons are described below.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To help you understand how the pros and cons apply to transparency, consider an example in which a moderator publicly warns another user not to call someone a “retard” because it violates an existing “No Slurs Allowed” rule.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Pros</span></h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Accountability</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">: A transparent moderation system holds moderators accountable to their own rules. For example, if a moderator were to call someone the same word, other users would know that behavior isn’t acceptable and could report it to an admin.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Community</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">: Allowing the community to see when someone gets warned and why helps foster dialogue between moderators and regular users regarding server culture and rule enforcement and encourages cooperation. Users that may not understand the reason why calling someone that word is prohibited can become educated on the moderators’ position. Moderators may also be able to clear up any misunderstandings community members may have about what slurs are included in the rule and can update the rule accordingly if need be.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Comprehension</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">: Providing users with practical examples helps them understand the difference between right and wrong. Users that were previously unfamiliar with what an “ableist slur” looks like now have a practical example to reference.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Compliance</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">: Users can proactively and correctly encourage good behavior themselves without moderator intervention. Once users know that calling someone that word is unacceptable, they can echo that message throughout the server and let others know that that behavior isn’t tolerated.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Cons</span></h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Testing the Limits</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">: Malicious users may take advantage of transparency to skirt the rules without punishment, or to manage their infractions to just barely avoid being banned. In the example above, users may try to censor or alter the word to have it slip under the radar of any watching moderators</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Rules lawyers</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">: Transparency may encourage “rules lawyers”  in which users will attempt to use the letter of the rules without reference to the spirit of the rules to appeal their warnings and punishments in bad faith. Explaining that the slur in question was used to insult those diagnosed with mental disability and is thus prohibited may prompt a bad faith counterargument that “fa****t” should be allowed because it used to mean “a bundle of sticks.”</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Harassment: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderators taking action or users that were punished may be subject to harassment by server members. Users may also feel harassed if they are publicly warned by a moderator. The person who was warned may carry a stigma with them in future interactions or be made fun of. Even if no one treats them differently in the future, they may feel embarrassed at being publicly criticized for their behavior. Conversely, those who sympathize with the warned user may start harassing the mod for being “too sensitive.”</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Privacy</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">: Transparency may cause moderators or users to feel that their privacy is insufficiently protected in relation to moderation issues.The lack of privacy can result in harassment or embarrassment as mentioned above. Furthermore, if the evidence for the case is preserved in public view then additional messages and usernames may be visible even if the original messages are later deleted by their authors.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Moderation System</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now that you are aware of some of the pros and cons of transparency in moderation, you must next understand the components of the moderation system so that you can consider ways in which these components can be made more or less transparent. Broadly speaking, a moderation system can be split into the following components:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Server rules and penalties for breaking them</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Guidelines for the moderation team to ensure consistent enforcement of the rules and penalties</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Logging and communication of user infractions and applying the appropriate penalty</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Processing appeals from users related to their logged infractions</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Transparency and communication go hand-in-hand. The more you communicate these components to relevant users and the server as a whole, the more transparent your moderation system is.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Implementing Transparency</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are several ways to implement transparency in each of these components, each with their own pros and cons. Each section here will establish ways in which a component can be made more or less transparent and a recommendation of the appropriate level of transparency for each. However, please keep in mind that every server’s needs are different and some of the pros and cons discussed may not apply to your server. It is always important to consider your specific community when it comes to implementing transparency.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Server Rules and Penalties</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Your server rules are the backbone of your moderation system. They describe how your members should conduct themselves and what happens if they don’t meet those expectations. In general though, your rules should be specific enough to ensure comprehension and compliance without being overly wordy or attempting to provide an exhaustive description of prohibited behaviors.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, giving a couple of examples of NSFW content for a “no NSFW content rule” may help people understand what you interpret as being NSFW, compared to other servers or Discord itself. However, too many examples may make the list seem fully comprehensive, and people will assume that items not on the list are fair game. Disclaiming that examples of rule-breaking content are non-exhaustive and that the moderators have the final say in interpreting if someone is breaking the rules can help to address users that are interested in testing the limits of the rules or being rules lawyers to escape punishment on a technicality.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderation Guidelines</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Developing moderator guidelines is another important part of your moderation system. Similar to your rules guiding the conduct of your server members, your moderator guidelines help guide the conduct of your moderators.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Keeping your moderator guidelines visible to the rest of the server will encourage compliance from members, and enable them to defuse incidents without moderator intervention. Furthermore, providing basic standards of moderator conduct will help users know when it’s appropriate to report moderators to the server owner for misconduct and hold them accountable. However, you should avoid putting too much of your moderator guidelines out in the public in order to avoid rules lawyers deliberately misinterpreting the spirit of the guidelines to their advantage. After developing your moderator guidelines, balancing these pros and cons will help you determine how much of your guidelines you should present to the public.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Infraction Logging</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Logging user infractions is key to ensuring that the entire moderation team has the same understanding of how often a user has broken the rules. Transparency between the mod team and the user in question is important for the user to understand when they have received a warning that brings them closer to being banned from the server. Informing the user of which moderator warned them is important for holding moderators accountable to the warnings they issue, but may leave moderators open to harassment by warned users. Having a procedure to deal with harassment that stems from this, is one way to achieve accountability while still protecting your moderators from bad actors in your server.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Although the communication of infractions is vital to ensure understanding among your server members, it may be prudent to withhold information about exactly how close a user is to being banned so that they do not attempt to toe the line by staying just under the threshold for being banned. Furthermore, even though a public infraction log may be a good way to promote cohesion and transparency by showing examples of unacceptable behavior to the rest of the server and fostering discussion between the mod team and community, others may think that such a log infringes on user privacy or that these logs may constitute a “witch hunt.” It may also leave mods and users open to harassment over warnings given or received.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you want to encourage a sense of community and understanding without taking away user privacy or inadvertently encouraging harassment, a better option may be to encourage users to bring up criticisms of rules or enforcement in a feedback channel if they wish to. Provided that the mod team ensures these conversations remain constructive and civil, creating a public medium for these conversations will help others understand how the mod team operates and allow them to provide feedback on how the server is run.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Managing Appeals</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Everyone makes mistakes, and moderators are no exception. It is important to have a process for users to appeal their warnings and punishments if they feel that they were issued unfairly. If you decide to have a public infractions log, you may receive appeals on behalf of warned users from people who were uninvolved in the situation if they feel the warning was issued unfairly. While this can help with accountability if a user is too nervous to try to appeal their warning, it can also waste the time of your mod team by involving someone that does not have a complete understanding of the situation. In general, it is better to keep the appeal process private between the moderation team and the punished user, primarily via mediums such as direct messages with an administrator or through a mod mail bot. During the appeal process, it is best to ensure that you clearly and calmly walk through the situation with the appealing user to help them better understand the rules while maintaining moderator accountability.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In the end, there is not a single “correct” way to manage transparency in your moderation system. The appropriate level of transparency will vary based on the size of the server and the rules that you implement. However, walking through the steps of your moderation system one by one and considering the various pros and cons of transparency will help you determine for yourself how to incorporate transparency into your moderation system. This will help you build trust between moderators and non-moderators while preventing abuse on both ends of the system. </span></p>"')

Keep in mind that every situation is unique. Because of this, you may find it difficult to understand what exactly you should do in each different scenario.

Sometimes the context and motives are immediately apparent with the action, such as a user’s intent to cause disruption by spamming gore in your server. You can see right away that no additional context is needed and that their motives are demonstrated clearly, so you can go right to proportional response. In this case, the user is typically banned and <a href=\\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000291932-How-to-Properly-Report-Issues-to-Trust-Safety\\">reported to Discord’s Trust &amp; Safety team</a>.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Situation Identification</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are two questions you should ask yourself whenever something catches your attention: </span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Is something happening?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Does this need a moderator?</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">These questions are rather straightforward, but sometimes the answer may be a little unclear. Typically a member’s disruption in the chat will catch your eye. This disruption may be a variety of different things: they might be explicitly breaking your server’s defined rules, treating other members harshly, bringing the quality of your chat down through their behavior, or perhaps just a small yet visible disagreement. If you confirm that something like this is happening, you can then ask yourself the next question: Do I need to intervene?</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When a member begins to disrupt your server, this member may need intervention from a moderator to </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">prevent the situation from escalating</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. However, while it may be your first instinct to step in as a moderator when something happens, take a step back and evaluate if that’s necessary. If two members have a disagreement on a subject, this doesn’t always mean that the situation will become heated and require your intervention. Disagreements are common not only on Discord but in any sort of open forum platform where everyone can voice their opinion on whatever anyone else says. Disagreements are a natural part of conversation and can encourage healthy discourse. As long as a disagreement does not turn into a heated argument, disagreements tend to be mostly benign.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are, however, also cases that will require a moderator’s intervention. If a situation seems to be escalating into harassment rather than simple disagreement, or if members are posting things that break your server’s rules, you can determine that it’s appropriate for you to intervene. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Information Gathering</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After you’ve confirmed to yourself that something needs your attention, you should begin the next step of gathering information. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Before we get into that though, it’s good to note that there are certain scenarios in which you would entirely skip this step and immediately move on to the third step- involving de-escalation or handing down a corrective action. Situations like these are ones in which you can tell right away that additional context is unnecessary and that something needs to be done, typically immediately. Situations like this could be:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Posting NSFW in non-marked channels</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Posting gore</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Mass spamming</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Call to arms (Raiding threats, posting IPs and asking for DDoS, etc)</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In cases like these, additional deliberation is unnecessary as the violations are obvious. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For more ambiguous cases however, you should consider the context of the situation and the motives of the user.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Considering Context</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Context is the surrounding circumstances of each situation. This includes the events that happened before the incident, the interaction history of those involved, the infraction history of those involved, and even how long they’ve been in your server.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Consider the scenario where a user uses a racial slur. Some may think that the user should immediately have corrective action taken against them, but that may not be the case. This user could have been explaining an issue they run into in the real world, or they could be asking someone else not to use the word. With additional information at hand, it may become evident that the transgression is less severe than initially thought, or perhaps even a non-violation at all. The exact action taken will depend on your rules, but it’s clear that understanding all of the relevant information is key to ensuring you take appropriate and proportional action.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Motives</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Another thing to consider when you first approach a scenario is the underlying motives of those involved. What are they trying to achieve? What is their goal by doing what they’re doing? </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, if two users are trading mild insults, it is possible to interpret this as friendly banter if you know these two people are good friends. Conversely, if you know these people dislike each other, then their motives may be less than friendly. Knowing your members well will therefore help you better to assess when a situation that needs intervention is occurring.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Initial Response</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now that y</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">ou’ve confirmed both the context of the situation and the underlying motives of the individual(s), you can decide what action you should take. Unless you deem the conduct of a user to be notably severe, a typical initial response is to de-escalate or defuse the situation. This means you attempt to solve the situation by verbal communication rather than moderation action, such as an official warning, a mute, or a ban. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">De-Escalation</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When it comes to de-escalation, you should remember that the members involved are typically going to be annoyed or upset at that moment due to the situation at hand. If you approach the situation from a stern and strict stance immediately, you could upset the members further and fan the flames, so to speak. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An example of verbally mitigating an argument that\'s turning too heated would be to say “Hey guys! While we appreciate discussion and think disagreement is healthy for promoting productive discourse, we think this particular discussion may have gone a little too far. Could we please change the subject and talk about something else? Thanks!”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now, consider what this statement aims to accomplish. It starts positive and friendly, thanking the users for their participation on the server. Showing this appreciation can help to calm the members involved. The message then states the reason for the intervention. Doing this respectfully is important, because if you aren’t respectful to your members, they aren’t going to be respectful to you. This effect is amplified on community servers where you are going to be interacting with the same active members on a regular basis. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After clarifying the reason for intervention, you should make the request on what you expect to happen going forward. In this situation, this is asking the members to move on. It’s important to note that phrasing the request as a question rather than an order is a deliberate choice. The message thanks them one more time as a way to end it on a positive note. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Your goal here is to defuse the situation so things don’t get worse</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. Keeping all of these things in mind when you phrase your communications is important.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">De-escalation is a skill that you may struggle with initially. Being comfortable with it requires many different interactions and experiences with many different moderation scenarios. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it immediately. You’re going to run into scenarios where you simply aren’t able to effectively defuse the situation and may have to rely on a corrective action instead. It is still a very good idea to generally approach these situations without the intent of punishing someone. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Not every situation needs to end with a punishment</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. The one skill that can take you from a good mod to an outstanding mod is the ability to defuse situations swiftly and efficiently.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Proportional Response</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you’ve tried to defuse a situation and they fail to listen, or continue to escalate, your next step is deciding what other effective means you have to end the situation at hand. So, what exactly should you do? </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Most servers tend to follow a proportional response system. This means that members tend to receive corrective action proportional to the acts they commit. If we think about our situation where an argument got too heated and de-escalation techniques were ineffective, we may want to consider restricting the privileges of the members involved. This serves as a punishment that is appropriate for the scenario while also allowing them the time they need to cool down and move on. Other examples of where a mute may be appropriate are minor spam, they are clearly inebriated, if a user is a little too harsh, or if someone needs time to cool off. It’s important to note that an official warning could also be given as an alternative which is typically done through a moderation bot. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After you apply this mute, it is worth looking at the history of the members involved in the incident to determine if the mute is all you need. If these members have a history of being problematic in chat, you may consider removing them from your community.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It’s important to remember that the goal of the moderation team is to promote healthy activity in our communities. With this in mind, it’s also good to remember that moderators and members are ultimately a part of that same community and that </span><strong>you don’t want to intimidate the people that rely on you</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. If you react too harshly, you run the risk of establishing a negative relationship between you and your community. People in your community should feel safe approaching you about an issue. Just like in the real world, they want to be confident that if it ever comes to them being reported, they’ll be treated </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">fairly</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. If you’re scared of being banned from the server because of a small disagreement, you tend to not want to engage with the server to begin with. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Inversely, if you don’t react strongly enough, you allow those who wish to disrupt your community more time and opportunity to do so and you may not be trusted by your community to handle situations.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Situation Closure</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After you’ve dealt with a scenario, it may be appropriate to take action in other places as well. Questions may arise from other members, your staff may need to know about this incident in the future, or tensions may remain high where the incident occurred.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Informing Staff</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is important to log this incident with the other members of your staff for future reference. There are many ways to do this, whether that be sending a message in your private staff channel, logging it within a bot, or maybe posting about it in your moderation log. These all provide you with a means to go back and check the history of these users and their run-ins with staff. It is important that you’re diligent about keeping these records. Other staff might not know about the incident and similarly you may not be aware of other incidents handled by your fellow staff members. If you find yourself in a situation where the problem user causes issues in the future, you will be able to quickly access the infraction history. This will allow you to appropriately adjust your response to the situation and emphasizes the importance of context when taking action.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Tension Resolution</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Tensions may linger where the incident occurred. Other members may see what happened and feel second-hand discomfort or anger depending on the situation. It may be necessary to resolve this tension by thanking the other members of chat for their patience and/or bringing it to your attention and stating that it was solved. This has the side effect of answering where the users went and why it happened. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, if two users had a heated argument in your chat and you ended up muting them, third-party observers may see this argument in chat and react negatively to the comments made during the argument. You can resolve this by stating something along the lines of “Sorry about that everyone. Situation resolved, users will be muted for a time to cool down.” This statement has the effect of stating what you did and why you did it. Acknowledging the situation as well as detailing that it’s been handled is an effective means to ease tensions and bring healthy discussion back to your chat. Keep in mind though, if the conversation has already moved on by the time you’ve dealt with the incident, this step may not be necessary. Bringing the conversation back to this issue may have the opposite effect and remind people of the uncomfortable situation.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You should now be able to confidently approach each situation and determine what the best way to handle it is. That being said, this is just a portion of your foundation. First hand experience is invaluable and necessary in order to be more efficient and fluent in moderating. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the most undervalued tools in moderation is your voice as a person in a position of power and your ability to defuse a situation, so don’t be afraid of trying to mitigate a situation first. If you’re still in doubt about what to do, never be afraid to ask your other staff members, especially those who may be more experienced.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Remember: Situation identification, information gathering, initial response, and situation closure. Keeping these steps in mind will help you stay on track to becoming a better mod and better community lead.   </span></p>\\n<p> </p>"')

Regardless of the consequences, users may want to appeal a moderator’s action to </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">prove that they did not do anything wrong, </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">do not deserve the punishment given to them, </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">or argue that the punishment should be less severe than initially prescribed.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Why Should You Consider an Appeal System?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For most types of warnings this can be as simple as messaging a moderator or sending a message in an appeal channel, if one exists. However, because a ban removes the user from the server and prevents them from returning, dealing with those ban appeals requires extra consideration from the mod team.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example: A user is banned for six months due to spamming racial slurs but feels that they have learned their lesson and should be allowed to return after three months. How should they go about reaching out to the moderator team to communicate their intentions and make their case? How should the mod team intake this information and send a response?</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We all make mistakes in life and your members or moderators are no exception to that rule. Whether it is a user realizing what they did wrong or a moderator making a mistake, an appeal system will provide a clearly documented method for the user to get a review of their case by the server’s moderation team. Without an established system, users may try to direct message a moderator to appeal which may not lead to a fair evaluation, or will try to evade the ban altogether with an alternative account.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Types of Appeal Systems</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The first step to adding an appeal system to your server is examining the different possibilities that are available to you. To pick the appeal system that is right for your server you should consider the size and type of server in order to properly match it to your use case. Whatever method you choose it should always be clearly communicated to your users.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Email</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Requesting users to appeal a ban can be done via email. For example, you can set up a simple email address for people to message, such as appeals@yourdomain.com</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You can decide if you want users to use a certain format or more like write whatever looks necessary for you</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Allows you to take advantage of your mailbox’s sorting, labeling, and prioritization features</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Your mailbox will always be up &amp; running (as long as your server is), no worries about having outages or downtime in Discord</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Appealing users will need to share an email address with the staff team</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The mailbox is susceptible to spam</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There is no sure way to verify that the sender is who they claim to be</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord Bot</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Using a Discord bot for ban appeals is another option.

You can combine this with the option of using a bot for appeals which would help to avoid a situation where certain privacy settings prevent users from sending a Direct Message to the bot.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Everything is kept on Discord, no need to go to another platform for appealing</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The appeal process is simple and you can’t fake identities</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In case you don’t want some users to appeal/re-appeal you can block their ability to appeal by banning them from the server</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Banned users can spam the server</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Website</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If your community already uses a website, it is a good idea to integrate your appeal process to the website. This form can be enhanced via the Discord API, by requiring the user to log in to their account. Another possible enhancement is using a webhook to submit ban appeals, so that moderators can see all the incoming appeals straight within Discord. </span></p>\\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Users can easily fill out an appeal by answering questions in a form</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The appeal submissions are integrated with Discord</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Since users must login to Discord in order to submit an appeal, there is no chance that an appeal could be faked or illegitimate.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This system requires technical expertise to implement and might cost money to keep up and working.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Normalizing the use of the form may be difficult, as this is an atypical method of handling ban appeals</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The website may be affected by outages</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The user won’t get feedback on their ban appeal without a moderator reaching out</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Online Form</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For smaller servers, the use of an online survey form (such as Google Forms) is pretty easy &amp; effective.

This non exhaustive list can be used as an initial checklist for your mod team when evaluating appeals. </span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Check if the content of the appeal is correct. </strong>First, you want to check the content of the appeal. Are all the questions completely answered with valid responses? Are there any obvious troll messages or responses? Does the user understand what action they are appealing, and why it was wrong?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Read their appeal thoroughly. </strong>Carefully read their appeal and identify all the details. Review the logs or history of the user in the server to find the context in which the moderation action against the user happened. You can also use the context and history to ascertain if they were truthful in their appeal or not. Have a look at their history: has this user been punished before, especially in regards to the action that got them banned? The type and frequency of their misbehavior will help you decide whether or not their ban reason is a chronic problem, or a one time mistake. This will make the process easier. If the user lies in their appeal, jump to step 6.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Look at the punishment reason. </strong>The severity of the infraction(s) should be considered when evaluating an appeal. For example, being a minor disruptive nuisance is a very different offense to doxxing someone and threatening to murder them.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Was the punishment executed correctly? </strong>The next step is going back in time, finding the moment of the ban and auditing it. Did your staff member punish this user correctly, or were they being too strict? If you\'re not sure, contact the staff member who applied the ban and discuss it with them. This is where keeping good logs of moderation actions really comes in handy! </li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>What are the risks or benefits associated with unbanning the user? </strong>On one hand, the user could be demonstrating a concerted effort to change and they may be willing to become a positive force in the community. On the other hand, the user could be appealing just to continue their bad behavior once unbanned, and since that behavior appears to have been forgiven, other users may think that that user’s actions were less severe than they had assumed. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Discuss it with the moderators: </strong>Consider the results of answering the previous questions and decide on a final course of action as a mod team. If at an impasse, consider using a poll or deferring to more senior staff if necessary to formally tally a decision. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In this article, we discuss what appeals are, methods of adding an appeal system to your server, and some information to consider when handling an appeal.

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Permitting the discussion of sensitive topics on your server can allow users to feel more at home and engage with their trusted peers on topics they may not feel comfortable discussing with others. This can encompass subjects like politics, mental health, or maybe even their own personal struggles. Having dedicated channels can keep these topics as opt-in and in a dedicated space so that people who do not want to see this content can avoid it. This can also allow you to role gate the channel, making it opt-in, level gated, activity gated, by request only, or some other requirement to keep trolls or irresponsible users out. <br></span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Allowing Sensitive Topics in Your Community</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Establishing channels dedicated to sensitive topics can also be an exhausting drain on your moderation team and can invite unwanted content into your server. These channels can quickly get out of hand if they are not set up mindfully and moderated carefully and will often require their own sets of rules and permissions to be run effectively and safely. Whether you want these discussions to occur in your space at all is up to you and your team. Having channels for these topics takes a lot of work and special consideration for you to determine if it’s the right fit for your server.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In short: This document will serve to educate you on how best to discern if you want these different channels, whether it be a channel on venting, serious-topics, or a real world event. Keep in mind- no matter what topics (if any) that you decide to include in your server, remember that all content needs to be within Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Determining What is a Sensitive Topic</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The first step to determining whether to have sensitive topics channels in your server is to define what is considered a sensitive topic for your community. If you are running a server for people from a specific country, a discussion of that country\'s conflicts with other countries may be a sensitive topic. Conversely, if you are running something like a political debate server, that same topic can be relatively non-problematic and not upsetting to the members of the server. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are two main types of sensitive topics: triggering topics and contentious topics. A triggering topic is a topic or word that can prompt an increase or return of symptoms of a mental illness or mental distress due to trauma. A contentious topic is one that is controversial that has the potential to provoke heated arguments. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While sensitive topics can vary depending on what kind of server you own (e.g. a mental health server vs. a gaming server), keep in mind that there are topics that can be considered triggering and topics that can be considered contentious in most, if not all public spaces.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Triggering Topics</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Triggering topics can vary wildly from community to community depending on what the focus of the community is. For instance, in a community for transgender people, in-depth descriptions of a body or the discomfort some people experience because of their body is likely to be a triggering topic. There are some triggers that are very common and should be handled with the assumption that they will cause multiple people in your community to feel uncomfortable or even traumatized regardless of what type of community it is. This would include things like sexual assault, graphic depictions of violence, other traumatic experiences, suicide and self harm, eating disorders, parental abuse or neglect, etc. These more sensitive topics should likely be separated out from more community specific topics that have the potential to invoke trauma such as transitioning or coming out in a server for LGBTQ+ people. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channel Names</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channel names indicate to users the intended purpose of the channel. Carefully choosing your name can have a large impact on what the channel ends up being used for. For example, #personal-questions-and-advice versus  #tw-emotional-support-and-venting give users very different impressions of what the channel is for. If you want a channel where someone can ask “What are some ways to distract myself if I feel like hurting myself” or, “my teacher is being homophobic, what should I do?” but not graphic descriptions of the symptoms of trauma or vice versa, make sure the name of the channel reflects that. Including tw (trigger warning) or cw (content warning) in your channel name will give the impression that the latter is allowed and is what the channel is intended to be used for. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channel Rules</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channels that have the potential to bring crisis situations into a server or cause distress to other members of the community should have specific rules to minimize the potential harm. These rules could be pinned in the channel, have their own channel within a category that houses sensitive topics channels, or be included in the servers rules. The example list of rules below includes some harm mitigation strategies, as well as the potential downsides of each.</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Consider asking that anything extremely upsetting utilize a trigger warning (tw) or content warning (cw). A trigger/content warning gives users a heads up that the content they are about to look at has the potential to invoke mental distress or trauma. This allows the user to decide whether to look at it or avoid it. This can be done through adding spacing to messages to push content off screen so the warning is seen first, or utilizing spoiler tags to hide content from anyone who does not want to see it. Including an emoji with a spoiler tag can also help the message stand out. For example:</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360099059654/image_2020-12-07_231202.png\\" alt=\\"image_2020-12-07_231202.png\\"></span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Consider removing permissions for images/link embedding. Sometimes users will post images of self harm or weapons they intend to use on themselves in emotional support channels. </span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This can prevent users from uploading advice in the form of screenshots from other online resources. </span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Consider banning certain topics. If your moderators and server members aren’t professionally qualified to offer sound advice on a topic, it may be worth disallowing discussion of those topics. Saying the wrong thing to a person in crisis can make the situation worse. If a topic arises, the conversation can be ended at “We’re not qualified, here are ways to contact people who are.”</span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This can be seen as callous or upsetting to other server members, or the member in crisis. While putting an end to a discussion related to one of your members in a crisis will be uncomfortable, it may still be an effective and safe way to deal with situations that require expertise beyond that of your mod team or other server members.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Consider creating a role or using channel permissions to allow you to ban people from the channel entirely if they seem to be incapable of following the channel rules but are otherwise a positive member of the community and follow the server wide rules. </span>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Adding a role to a user can draw attention to and further punish the user. Other users may see and inquire about the unfamiliar role. Adding channel permissions allows more privacy but will clutter your permissions and likely not be very scalable if this option is used frequently.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Keep a list of resources on hand that can be shared if someone mentions that they are in the midst of a crisis situation, this should include abuse hotlines, self harm/suicide hotlines and hotlines for parental abuse. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Be sure to seek out hotlines for the country that a majority of your users are from, or international hotlines that anyone can use.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderation Concerns</span></h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Emotional burnout from dealing with users in crisis or users asking for advice about upsetting personal issues can be detrimental to moderators. Whether moderators are actively engaging with users in the chat or just reading the chat to ensure it is not getting out of hand, the emotional toll is high. Moderators who engage with and moderate these spaces should understand their limits and how to manage burnout</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. </span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderating users who are in a crisis or really going through it is unpleasant and can make the staff team look harsh or uncaring to other users regardless of how egregious their behaviour is.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The chance for abuse in these channels is higher than the average channel. Users who overuse the channel and are in constant need of support/advice can quickly become a drain on the emotional well being of everyone involved with the channel. Know the red flags for emotional abuse and keep an eye out for users who are constantly in crisis and trying to manipulate users into doing things for them. </span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Trolls and malicious attention seekers will target this channel. They will come in with extremely upsetting sob stories and fake mental/physical health crises to make users panic, upset people, or just generally disturb the peace. Allowing them a space to soap box makes these sorts of users more difficult to pick out and remove before they can start doing damage.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some users will intentionally seek out content that they know will trigger them as a form of emotional self harm. It can be difficult to know whether this is happening in your server unless someone explicitly mentions that they are doing it.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If there is a separate team in charge of moderating or overseeing these channels, they will need to closely communicate with the rest of the moderation team about problem users or concerning behavior. </span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusions</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channels focused on sensitive topics can provide users with a comfortable space to discuss personal issues of varying severity and build closeness and trust between members of your community. These channels also have very specific risks and required mitigation strategies that will vary depending on the nature of the specific channel. If you are running a channel on transition advice for transgender users, your main concern will likely be fake advice about foods that change hormone levels or dangerous advice regarding illegally acquiring hormones. If you run a channel for sexual assault victims, your main concern will likely be victim blaming and ensuring that users reach out to professionals when needed. You have to consider what the specific risks in your channel are and ensure that you are writing policies that are specific to your needs and finding moderators that are knowledgeable and comfortable with those topics.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Contentious Topics</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There may be contentious topics for your community in particular, but in general politics, economics, law, current events, and morality are contentious topics for most servers. These topics are likely to cause disagreements as a lot of users will have very varied and very firm opinions on the topics. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channel Names</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A channel named #discussion-of-current-events and a channel named #political-debates-to-the-death are going to yield very different types of interactions. If you want a channel where people can mention politics and current events and discuss things like the stock market or a new law that was passed, but don’t want discussions about whether specific world leaders are good or bad, or what economic model is the best one, make sure your channel name reflects that. Many/most users won’t read anything but the channel name, so your channel name needs to set the correct expectation for the content individuals will find inside. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channel Rules</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channels that have the potential to get heated and cause arguments that lead to negative feedback loops should have specific rules to minimize the potential harm. These rules could be pinned in the channel, have their own channel within a category that houses contentious topics channels, or be included in the servers rules. The list of rules below includes some harm mitigation strategies, as well as the potential downsides of each.</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Explicitly disallow bigotry and hate speech of any form. Remember that this behavior is also against Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines and shouldn’t be allowed in any situation on your server, sensitive topics or not.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Consider requiring that users provide sources to back up claims. This prevents users from trying to make others argue against complete nonsense that is only supported by fringe conspiracy theorists, or is demonstrably false. </span></li>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Users who are acting in bad faith can abuse this and request that every statement ever have a credible source and bog down people who are citing credible sources they do not have on hand at the time.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Consider banning some topics. Some topics just shouldn’t be allowed to be debated. This could include dangerous conspiracy theories, triggering topics, nsfw topics, or topics that are particularly harmful to debate amongst the membership of your type of community.</span></li>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Users may complain about free speech or that some of the banned topics shouldn’t be banned. They may also ask you to ban other topics that you may not think are really a problem. </span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Consider dis-allowing “devils advocate” style statements. If your channel doesn’t exist for arguing for the sake of arguing, don’t allow people to make arguments that they don’t believe in for the sake of stirring up more discussion.</span></li>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Users may complain about free speech, or claim that they do believe in arguments. There’s no way to confirm whether people believe what they’re saying or not. </span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Consider setting up permissions to enforce a slower chat. Things like slow mode and temporary channel locks for “cool off” periods can help to keep things calm in the chat. </span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderation Concerns</span></h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderation actions can look biased if a moderator is engaging in a conversation, disagrees with a user and then needs to moderate them for behavior in the same channel. </span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderators can be upset by the content of the channel, or the opinions/conduct of another user even if no rules are being broken and respond inappropriately.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Trolls and malicious users will target this channel. People will come in to spout stupid or offensive opinions to start arguments. They will also ping pong between extremely contentious topics until someone takes the bait. If the comments they are making and the general behavior of trying to start a debate about anything are allowed on the server, it will be more difficult to remove them before they get the chance to be disruptive.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Misinformation can be spread in the channel, moderators must have a good understanding of current events in order to prevent dangerous misinformation or conspiracy theories from being proliferated in their communities. </span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If there is a separate team in charge of moderating or overseeing these channels, they will need to closely communicate with the rest of the moderation team about problem users or concerning behavior.</span> </li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusions</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channels focused around contentious topics can provide users with an engaging space to discuss topics with people from varied backgrounds and explore other perspectives. These channels also have very specific risks and required mitigation strategies that will vary depending on the nature of the specific channel. For example, if you are running a channel on COVID19, your main concern will likely be dangerous misinformation and conspiracy theories. If you run a channel for the 2020 US Presidential Election, your main concern may be things getting too heated or insult-flinging. You have to consider what the specific risks in your channel are and ensure that you are writing policies that are specific to your needs and finding moderators that are knowledgeable and comfortable with the topics.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Current Events</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Current event channels are for a single and specific current event, such as COVID-19 or mourning a beloved server member. Depending on the topic of the channel, it may also be a contentious or sensitive topic, but differs because it is a narrowly focused and usually temporary space. These channels can be useful to have if a topic either isn’t allowed per your servers rules, or is allowed but is overwhelming conversations in other channels (but is otherwise not something you want to outright ban the discussion of). </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channel Names</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channel names for specific current events should be as clear as possible. For instance, making a channel for the COVID-19 Pandemic and then naming the channel “Diseases” makes little sense. Instead, you would want to be </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">specific </span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">and name it something like “COVID-19 Pandemic” or “COVID-19”. This ensures that your users will at-a-glance understand what the channel is for. You should also have a topic for the channel that helps inform users of its purpose. You may also want to have something like “Read The Rules” in the topic, so users know to read any additional rules. These rules could be pinned in the channel, have their own channel within a category that houses contentious topics channels, if you have multiple, or be included in the servers rules. Also keep in mind that users may not always read the channel topic or pinned messages.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channel Rules</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channels covering current events should have rules that help promote healthy discussion of these topics. While each real world event may be different, there are some baseline rules / guidelines that we believe these channels should have.</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Do not spread misinformation. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A rule like this is incredibly important, especially for topics that relate to public safety (such as COVID-19). </span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Keep conversations on-topic. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Making sure that conversations do not go too off-topic will let others jump in and give their own insight. If a conversation becomes too meme-y or off-topic, then it will be harder for others to jump in and it could turn the channel into an off-topic channel.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Be respectful and try to keep arguments to a minimum. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Arguments in these kinds of channels will flair up, but it is important as a moderator to ensure they do not devolve into name-calling or personal attacks. If an argument does flare up, try to ensure that users tackle the arguments and ideas presented and not the user that presented them.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Encourage others to jump in and give their thoughts. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are usually many different viewpoints when it comes to real-world events. Especially ones that warrant their own channel. So it is good to encourage those with different viewpoints to chime in with their own points of view.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channels like these can be difficult to manage. On one hand, you want things to be contained and on-topic. On the other hand, you may want to allow for other kinds of discussion that relate to the topic at-hand. Ultimately it is up to you to decide how to best implement these channels. Whether the channel is for a global pandemic, a friend passing away, a game releasing, or anything in-between, these channels will require a special finesse that other channels may not. It is our hope that these example rules and channel names can help you create a space that adheres to a specific topic and creates an atmosphere that is both respectful and engaging.</span></p>\\n<p><br><br></p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the best ways to grow or increase activity in your community is to put yourself in the shoes of your members, and experiment with ways to improve their experiences. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For new members, consider how they arrive in your server. What are the first things they see? Where do they have to go? What could help them understand why your community is awesome and get them to stick around? For existing members, consider why they come to your server. What are they doing? When do they talk the most? </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Afterwards, come up with a list of things to try and make those changes! This is when Server Insights comes in to play: you can use Server Insights to verify if your changes are actually working. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Here\'s a deeper dive on this framework</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Improving Member Acquisition</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The first component of strong community growth and engagement is making sure that the right people (aka “high-intent people”) are joining your server. In other words, you should consider “</span><strong>what are the characteristics of a member that will meaningfully contribute to the server, and where are (or aren’t) those members in my traffic sources?</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While the overall traffic source data trends can be helpful in explaining phenomena you’ve observed on your server, you could also use a Discord bot to track how individual members join your server. If you can think of a handful of good (or bad) members and find that they all came from the same invite link, this may provide valuable information about the quality of that traffic source.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, you may want to </span><strong>remove</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> your invite link from traffic sources that attract users who:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Do not speak your server language - This can occur if your invite link is shared in a foreign community or somewhere that has a high proportion of foreign users.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Join just to raid or troll - This </span><strong>can </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">occur as a result of listing your server on Discovery or third party listing sites, but not always.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Expect a server about a different topic -  For example, an American football server that is attracting Europeans who are actually looking to talk about soccer.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">However, you might want to </span><strong>add or further promote</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> your invite link on traffic sources that bring users who:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Are knowledgeable about your server topic.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Behave maturely and follow the server rules.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Help other people.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Provide a large amount of activity.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Making these adjustments to your traffic sources will help you attract a higher proportion of users that will interact more quickly with other members (improving activation), and encourage them to subsequently return to your server more frequently and over a longer period of time (improving retention). However, this only accounts for the beginning of a member’s server experience. The next step is to further encourage these new members to interact.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Improving Member Activation</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once you are attracting high-intent members to your server, you need to make sure that these new members are able to participate in your community and encourage them to do so. The best way to do this is to provide an easily understandable new member experience with a simple explanation of the server, and a clear ‘call to action’.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The first thing you should do is </span><a href=\\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043913591-Community-Server-Welcome-Screen\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">enable the Welcome Screen</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> in order to guide new members through your server’s layout and purpose. Directing people to the most important channels and providing a ‘call to action’, such as “introduce yourself here” will help new members know how to start their interaction with the community. These channels should have informative, easy to understand content that helps people know the purpose and rules of the server, as well as how to navigate it and use any special features you’ve implemented through Discord bots. Be sure to use concise and easy to understand role and channel names.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Limiting the number of channels visible to new members may also help them navigate the server more easily. Especially if your users are new to Discord, having a long channel list can be overwhelming. Some users may immediately leave if there are too many channels in the server. Fortunately, channel categories can help you keep your channel list organized. Keeping no more than five channels in a category makes it easy to navigate, and putting the most active categories at the top allows users to jump into the conversation without needing to scroll through a long list of channels before they’re ready. You can also make some channels opt-in and require people to type a bot command or click a reaction in order to join it, allowing them to define their own server experience.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you do need a significant amount of channels, include a welcome or informational channel at the top of your server that lists all of your channels with a brief description of their purpose. This will serve as a resource for new members that get lost in your server, and give them a quick overview of everything they can do.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You can also use a Discord bot to greet new members after they join, or even send them a direct message with a brief explanation of how to use your server. Mentioning new users in a general discussion channel gives them guidance about where they should start talking. Including a question prompt about your server’s topic, such as who their favorite character is in a game or anime, can encourage them to send that first message and start making connections. Regardless of what incentives or prompts you implement, getting members to participate in their first conversation is key to helping them find a place in your community.</span></p>\\n<h4>Implementing Verification</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Implementing a verification gate is a good way to protect your server from low-level trolls and spammers. However, it can also be a barrier to entry for legitimate members. In this case, you should ensure that your welcome screen guides members to the appropriate channels for members to verify and that your instructions for verifying are clear. If members still have issues completing verification, you may want to evaluate the most common mistakes and how you can better explain or implement the process. One option is to have a bot explain the process in a direct message or in a dedicated greeter channel</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Improving User Retention</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The next step is to ensure new members ultimately stick around and stay in the community. Improving member activation is an important component of achieving this step, since a user that has already interacted with other members of your community is much more likely to return and continue visiting your server. The concept of a user coming back to your server after their initial join is referred to as retaining a user. Discord measures “first week retention,” which is the proportion of members that </span><strong>visit </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">your server again between seven and 14 days after joining. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Announcement Channels</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If your server is focused around a game, TV show/series, anime, product or similar topic, invest in announcement channels that will provide your members with useful information and give them a reason to check on your server frequently. This includes both automated feeds, such as from a blog or a Twitter account, and manually curated news channels.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, giving new members a ‘news’ role when they join or allowing them to opt in to a news role will allow you to mention the role so that interested members can receive notice about important updates.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">However, it’s important to make sure members can remove this role if they don’t want it, and not to abuse tagging it. Members that receive too many mentions from a server may be more likely to mute all mentions from the server or even just leave entirely. When applicable though, providing regular updates in this fashion gives members an excellent reason to visit regularly and remain engaged.</span></p>\\n<h4>Encouraging Communication</h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A more universal - though more difficult - method of increasing user retention is to always make sure there is something to talk about on your server. Increasing the proportion of visitors that become communicators can be as simple as providing channels where people can talk about your server’s topic with others, ask for help, or engage in meaningful discussion. If your server is about a game that receives constant updates, for example, then there may be plenty of existing conversation material. These conversations can be further encouraged by making use of a leveling system through a Discord bot. As people chat, they can gain “exp” and level up on your server. These levels can grant special roles to the users or even special permissions. Such systems create a goal for which members can strive, and give them another reason to keep coming back. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you want to take matters into your own hands, consider implementing concerted community engagement efforts from your staff. This includes projects such as hosting server events, contests, and giveaways.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Experimenting and Measuring Results</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once you’ve optimized your server to improve acquisition, activation, and retention, you need to measure the results of your efforts. Some changes may be immediately visible in your insights, while others (such as ones made to improve retention) can take a week or two to show their effects.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Currently, server insights gives you the option to view statistics on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. These are all valuable ways to see how your server is performing in both the short and long term. However, it’s important to remember that because metrics such as communicators and visitors are tied to the individual user, </span><strong>the sum of the data for higher resolution time periods will not always equal the value for a lower resolution time period</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. For example, if one user visits your server every day for a week, they will be counted seven times if you view your insights at the daily level. However, if you view your insights at the weekly level, they will only count once. Analyzing your insights over multiple time resolutions may reveal slightly different patterns in each, and both the quantity and resolution of your data will affect your analysis results. While measuring changes in the first few days can help you understand any critical consequences, overall you should wait at least one or two weeks to ensure you have a representative amount of data and that daily variations are not complicating your insights.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is important to note that depending on the nature of your community and what changes you’ve made that there is an almost infinite number of ways to interpret changes in your server insights. What might be bad for your server might be good for another, or vice versa. Keep in mind the following caveats as you read about measuring results:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The actions listed here are limited to the ones discussed in this article, and are not exhaustive ways you can affect your server insights.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some actions may have additional possible results based on the nature of your community.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Implementing multiple changes at once may affect the same metric in conflicting ways or to a different extent. For example, if you add your invite link to one website and remove it from another website, the overall effect on your new member joins will depend on the net effect of both changes.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While the guidelines listed here are excellent ways to begin to understand how your actions affect your member insights, they are only guidelines. You should always evaluate your metrics critically and in your community’s context.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Measuring Member Acquisition</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Measuring acquisition is done using charts and tables on the Growth &amp; Activation tab. Although constant or mild growth is important to maintain the longevity of your community, what these users are (or aren’t) doing after they join your server is much more important than just joining it. While you should take corrective action if you notice your total membership decreasing over a long period of time, there is no absolute growth percentage or total number of members joining per day that indicates a healthy community. The table below summarizes the suggested actions to take to improve the quality and/or quantity of members joining your server and how you could expect these changes to affect your server insights on their own.</span></p>\\n<table style=\\"height: 601px;\\" border=\\"1px\\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr style=\\"height: 44px;\\">\\n<td style=\\"height: 44px; width: 265.5882263183594px;\\">\\n<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>\\n</td>\\n<td style=\\"height: 44px; width: 150.6985321044922px;\\">\\n<p><strong>Chart/Table Affected</strong></p>\\n</td>\\n<td style=\\"height: 44px; width: 249.02572631835938px;\\">\\n<p><strong>Expected Result</strong></p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr style=\\"height: 178px;\\">\\n<td style=\\"height: 178px; width: 265.5882263183594px;\\">\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Removing invite links from less relevant traffic sources will decrease server growth.</span></p>\\n</td>\\n<td style=\\"height: 178px; width: 150.6985321044922px;\\">\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How many new members are joining?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Total membership over time</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Most popular invites/referrers</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</td>\\n<td style=\\"height: 178px; width: 249.02572631835938px;\\">\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">New members joining decreases</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Total membership over time grows more slowly or decreases</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Total joins from the invite link/referrer decreases</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr style=\\"height: 178px;\\">\\n<td style=\\"height: 178px; width: 265.5882263183594px;\\">\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Adding or promoting an invite link on a relevant traffic source will increase server growth</span></p>\\n</td>\\n<td style=\\"height: 178px; width: 150.6985321044922px;\\">\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How many new members are joining?</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Total membership over time</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Most popular invites/referrers</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</td>\\n<td style=\\"height: 178px; width: 249.02572631835938px;\\">\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">New members joining increases</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Total membership over time increases more quickly or decreases more slowly</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Total joins from the invite link/referrer increases</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr style=\\"height: 201px;\\">\\n<td style=\\"height: 201px; width: 265.5882263183594px;\\">\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Improving the overall quality of referrers will attract people that are more likely to stay on your server and engage with your community</span></p>\\n</td>\\n<td style=\\"height: 201px; width: 150.6985321044922px;\\">\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Server leaves over time</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How many new members successfully activate on their first day?</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</td>\\n<td style=\\"height: 201px; width: 249.02572631835938px;\\">\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Members remain on your server after joining, decreasing server leaves over time from new members</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Members are more likely to want to engage with your server prior to joining, and will be more likely to talk or visit multiple channels</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Measuring Activation and Retention </span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Measuring the effects of changes to improve activation and/or retention is more complex than measuring acquisition due to their interrelated nature.

The ramifications of a verification gate are difficult to quantify and not easily summarized. Verification gates make it harder for people to join in the conversation of your server, but in exchange help protect your community from trolls, spam bots, those unable to read your server’s language, or other low intent users. This can make administration and moderation of your server much easier. You’ll also see that the percent of people that visit more than 3 channels increases as they explore the server and follow verification instructions, and that percent talked may increase if people need to type a verification command.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">However, in exchange you can expect to see server leaves increase. In addition, total engagement on your other channels may grow at a slower pace. User retention will decrease as well. Furthermore, this will complicate the interpretation of your welcome screen metrics, as the welcome screen will need to be used to help people primarily follow the verification process as opposed to visiting many channels in your server. There is also no guarantee that people who send a message after clicking to read the verification instructions successfully verified. In order to measure the efficacy of your verification system, you may need to use a custom solution to measure the proportion of people that pass or fail verification.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After taking the time to understand your community, you can begin to implement changes that improve your member experience and boost your server performance.

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Occasionally while modding a community, you’ll come across one individual who refuses to abide by the rules in any way. They just can’t seem to help but repeatedly break the rules, harass other users, or evade bans by creating new accounts to continue their bad behavior. In this article we’ll review how to deal with users that constantly cause trouble or evade bans, and the active steps you can take to get it to stop. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Understanding High Conflict Persons (HCPs)</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The vast majority of community members are interested and willing to participate according to the platform rules, even if they might not agree with every one of them. Sometimes people break rules or disagree, but their behavior can be quickly corrected and they can learn from their mistakes. If users continue to break the rules, they may be given longer-term or even permanent bans from the community or platform. Most users will accept their ban, but a small fraction will not.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A </span><a href=\\"https://snap.stanford.edu/conflict/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">2018 study by Stanford University</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> estimated that 1% of subreddit communities on Reddit initiate 74% of all conflict on the platform. This incredibly small percentage of users rank extremely low in the agreeableness personality trait, and have no interest in getting along with others. Only a trained clinical psychologist can diagnose a patient with a disorder, but a term commonly used prior to diagnosis is HCP (high-conflict people). There are four primary characteristics of high conflict personalities, which is not a diagnosis but their description of specific conflict behavior:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Preoccupation with blaming others (their \\"targets of blame\\")</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">All-or-nothing thinking</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Intense or unmanaged emotions</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Extreme behaviors (often what 90% of people would never do)</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you fail to use tact in your moderation technique and communication approaches, you may find that you or your community become the target of a high-conflict person. They may spam your community and you may delete their posts and ban their accounts, but more accounts can be created. Discord uses IP bans to prevent users from creating new accounts, but VPNs can be used to circumvent these bans. If truly motivated, armies of bot accounts can be created and used for mass-spamming, members of your community can be doxed, and ISPs or platforms can be DDoS’d to create fear in your community. If a high-conflict person gains access to money, they can pay somebody else to do the work for them.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Most moderators choose to simply wait out the harassment. Advanced harassment like this may go on for several days, or even weeks, but then stop abruptly as the individual turns their attention to something new in their life. In some cases the harassment can go on for months, continuing to escalate in new ways that may put the lives of your team or community members in danger.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What can you do to protect your community from High Conflict Persons? What motivates a person to behave like this? This article will help to explain the motivations behind this persistent, destructive behavior, and provide actionable steps to reduce or resolve their harassment.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Virtue of Battling a Nemesis</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A “nemesis” is an enemy or rival that pursues you relentlessly in the search for vengeance. A nemesis typically holds some degree of fascination for a protagonist, and vice versa. They’re an antagonist who’s bent on revenge, who doesn’t go away, and who seems to haunt the mind of the protagonist. They’ve moved past being an enemy to become something much more personal.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You might assume that a high-conflict person harassing your community is your nemesis, but this would be incorrect. You’re not going out of your way to obstruct their behavior, your primary focus is to engage and moderate your community. If the harassment stopped, you would move on and forget about their behavior. You resist their behavior only as long as it falls under your realm of influence.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In their mind, </span><strong>you</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> have become </span><strong>their</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> nemesis, and you must be punished for your insolence.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To them, you are the Architect of an oppressive Matrix, the President Snow of an authoritarian Hunger Games, the tyrannical Norsefire government in V for Vendetta. You or your community represent the opposite of what they believe. In one way or another, either by your direct actions or through your association with your community, you have wronged them and deserve to suffer for your behavior. It’s clear that you will never learn or understand what they see. You not only participate in creating the corrupt and unjust system that they are oppressed by and fight against, but as a moderator, you are the very lynchpin that maintains the corrupt system. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You may believe this sounds outlandish, and you would be correct. Most people don’t believe that the world is out to get them, and that they’ll be hunted down and persecuted for what they believe. These individuals have an overactive threat detection system that makes them believe that you or your community are actively plotting their downfall. They take your opposing stance as a direct challenge to their competence, authority and autonomy. They harass you and your community because they believe that you’re out to get them, or want to replace them and their way of life. The truth is, all you really want them to do is follow the rules and maintain a civil conversation.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Understanding Tactical Empathy</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now that you have a better understanding of how somebody like this thinks, we’ll discuss the strategies that you can employ to solve this problem. The goal is NOT to get them to seek help or change their mind- we aren’t attempting to </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">solve</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> people. Instead, our goal is to prevent or stop certain negative behaviors that keep happening so that you can protect your community and focus your energy elsewhere.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The key to getting an individual like this to change their behavior is through utilizing “tactical empathy”. Tactical empathy is the use of emotional intelligence and empathy to influence another’s behavior and establish a deal or relationship. It is not agreeing with them, but just grasping and recognizing their emotions and positions. This recognition allows us to act appropriately in order to respond to our counterpart’s position in a proactive and deliberate manner.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The premise behind tactical empathy is that no meaningful dialogue takes place when we are not trusted or we are perceived as a threat. In order to get someone to stop harassing your community, you need to shift yourself from being the villain of their story to being just another random person in their lives. You must work to shatter the persona that they have projected onto you and show that you are not the enemy working to destroy them. You’re just a mod trying to keep your community safe.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">By demonstrating that you understand and respect them as an individual, this will disarm them and allow them to focus their energy elsewhere. It will not change their opinion, but at least their behavior will change.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A Mod’s Guide to Situation Diffusal</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When somebody continues to harass or disrupt your community, they’re essentially holding your community hostage. If someone truly is holding your community “hostage”, they’re often doing so because they’re looking to open a dialogue for negotiation. Frequently, people take hostages because they need somebody to </span><strong>listen</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. They aren’t getting the attention that they believe they deserve, and attempt to cause as much disruption as possible in order to make their case.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You are a community moderator negotiating the peace of your community, not their lives, but these tactics can still apply.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Situation diffusal can generally be defined by three primary processes, each designed to collect information and use it to disarm the high-conflict person from believing that you’re an enemy or threat. These processes are called The Accusations Audit, Mirroring to Understand and Getting to “That’s Right”.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Accusations Audit</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An accusations audit is where you focus not on just the things that they believe, but the things that </span><strong>they</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> believe </span><strong>you</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> did wrong. An accusation Audit is not based on logic - it’s based on the unfiltered emotions of the other person. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It’s important that you go through their early comments and messages to understand what prompted this behavior in the first place. This might have been banning them breaking a rule (which is what you’re supposed to do, this isn’t to say that you aren’t acting unreasonably) or not properly punishing another community member they got into an argument with. They might believe “I feel like you didn’t give me a chance to explain myself” or “I feel like you’re discriminating against me”. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Your understanding of their beliefs will be flawed and inaccurate, but you must do your best to piece it together into a coherent argument on their behalf. If possible, learn more about the other communities they’re a part of. Identify if they’re harassing any other communities, and the reasons for doing so. Are there any commonalities of note? </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Mirroring to Understand</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once you believe you’ve figured out why they’re upset with you or your community, mirror their language to verify it. At this point, opening a dialogue might be incredibly difficult if they’re using throwaway accounts regularly. Chances are they do have a primary account they continue to use in other communities, which can help greatly with starting your dialogue. At this stage, you’re still working to collect information about what they believe, directly from the source. Examples of questions you can use to verify their opinions include, “It seems like you believe that I’m being unfair because I didn’t give you a chance to explain yourself.” or “If I understand correctly, you believe I’ve been discriminating against you instead of taking your opinion seriously, is that right?”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Chances are, the responses you receive will be filled with aggression, profanity and insults. You must ignore all of this, and continue working to understand their position and the events that resulted in them targeting your community. Negotiations like this are difficult in voice-to-voice communication, and nearly possible via instant or private messaging. They will be incredibly resistant at first, perhaps thinking that you’re attempting to trick them into a perjury trap for them to admit their guilt or ignorance.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When you get them talking to you, mirror that language to get them to elaborate further on their beliefs. An example of dialogue might go something like the following:</span></p>\\n<p><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Spammer: “It’s bullshit that mods ban strawberry jam lovers because the blueberry jam lovers are afraid of being exposed for who they really are.”</span></em></p>\\n<p><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Mod: “Afraid of being exposed?”</span></em></p>\\n<p><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Spammer: “Yeah, the blueberry jam lovers are secretly running the world and plotting against anyone who doesn’t believe in the same jam flavor preferences as they do.”</span></em></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Realistically, blueberry jam lovers are not actually running the world or plotting anything nefarious, but in the mind of the spammer this is undeniably true. And while this example was intentionally mild, you can infer more severe types of conversations that would follow a similar format. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Regardless, as you dig further into what they believe, you’ll notice that the rabbit hole will go very deep and be filled with logical fallacies and obviously disprovable biases that make no sense. Remember that the truth or reality behind what they believe is completely irrelevant, and attempts to correct them will undermine your goals. Your job is to help them explain their beliefs to you to the best of their ability, and for you to understand their position to the best of your ability. Once you believe you’ve collected enough information, you can move to the final step, getting to “That’s Right.”</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Getting to “That’s Right”</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once you believe you’ve completely understood their position and what they believe, you can repeat their entire position back to them. Demonstrate your understanding by effectively summarizing it concisely and accurately, regardless of how much you disagree with the position. Don’t focus on their behavior or the actions that resulted in them getting banned. Instead, focus exclusively on the ideology that drove their behavior. Do this until you’re able to get them to say “Yes, that’s right” at least 3 times, or by asking if there’s anything else that you forgot in your summary. If you did miss anything, repeat the entire position again while including the extra information. When reiterating their points, be very careful about restating things that are not true. Do your best to remove personal bias from the statements to focus them back to “absolute truths.”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Their actions are about trying to make a point- but what you’re doing is getting them to make their point without taking action, because you have heard what they are trying to say. If you do this well enough, if you put enough effort into doing this correctly (and it doesn’t need to be perfect), they will know that you finally understand where they’re coming from and that they’ve been heard by you, and their opinion has been validated. By demonstrating you understand their position, you go from being part of the problem to being a real person. They might not like you, but they will at least (if begrudgingly so) respect you.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">End on a High Note</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When you successfully reach this state of your discussion, it’s essential that you be careful with your choice of words. There’s a good chance that the spammer will leave your community alone now that they know that their opinion has been recognized. At the very least, you should see an immediate reduction in the number of times they attempt to cause harm.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If they do continue to harass you or your community, it’s possible that you failed to address the primary reason that they’re upset. Open dialogue with them again and follow the steps above from the beginning, or check to see that you haven’t fallen into a common pitfall or mistake.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Common Pitfalls and Mistakes</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Below is a list of common examples of mistakes people make during negotiations:</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Getting to “You’re Right” instead of “That’s Right”</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When using tactical empathy, remember that the purpose of the exercise is to bring their beliefs to the conscious mind and demonstrate agreement. If you attempt to tell them what they should believe, you may instead get a “you’re right” and fail to see any change. The difference is subtle, but important. Make sure that the other side actually feels heard, and that you’ve fully understood their position.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Don’t Try to Correct their Opinion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As a reminder: do not attempt to correct or modify their opinion. Remember the purpose of this process. It is not to modify their position or opinion, it’s only to mirror their opinion to stop identifying you and your community as a threat.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Be Careful with Tone and Wording</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The methodology outlined in this article is designed for conversations in real-life, especially over the phone. It’s unlikely that you’ll be able to get the spammer on an audio call, so it’s essential to be patient with the process and careful with your wording. Formal grammar like punctuation can make a sentence feel more serious or threatening. Use casual phrasing and make an occasional spelling mistake to show you’re human. If you’re uncertain about tone, read the sentence out loud while sounding as angry as you can, and adjust accordingly.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Remember to Ask for Help</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The process outlined here can be easily undermined by others who aren’t involved in the process. If you’re working to negotiate with a spammer but another moderator is threatening them in a different conversation, you won’t see any changes in their behavior. Communicate with your team on the strategy you plan to use, and remember to ask for emotional support or step away if it becomes too taxing.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Can High-Conflict People be Helped?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There will be some of you who believe that after getting this far, you may be on the path to rehabilitating a person like this. The mistake is believing that you are further along than you really are, or that you’re qualified to help someone struggling to control their emotions. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The truth is, getting to “that’s right” is only 1% of the process.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Even if you’re a clinical psychologist, you wouldn’t be getting paid for your work, at least not this work. Attempting to provide support via text chat will have diminishing returns. Attempting to show somebody like this the “error of their ways” may result in all of the work you have done being reversed.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Instead, you must focus on the people who want your help and who need it- this being the people in your community. Empower the people who are truly deserving of your time and energy. At the end of the day, you’re a human and a moderator. Your primary focus in this realm is to make sure your community is safe and stays safe- and if you’ve managed to get the persistent spammer to stop then you’ve accomplished what it is you’ve aimed to do. </span></p>"')

Will working with yet-another platform really help move my streaming career forward, or is it just another item on the endless list of distractions?</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Most of the streamers who ask this question fail to understand how Discord fits into their high-level plan for scaling their brand and community. One of the biggest misconceptions is that Twitch can be used for every step of growing your channel, brand, and community. Twitch is only one of many platforms required for success. While Twitch is well-known for engaging and monetizing your active community base, it struggles with content discovery, data collection, and long term retention. Twitch should instead be viewed as a tool to engage and connect with an already-existing community. </span></p>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360101290493/image_2020-12-07_233013.png\\" alt=\\"image_2020-12-07_233013.png\\"></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The image above categorizes content platforms into 3 primary groups; Discovery, Engagement, and Activation. Content platforms that focus on Discovery are specifically designed to spread new, persistent content that can be viewed later. These platforms are ideal for finding new community members and fans to engage with by inviting them to join another more personalized platform, such as a fansite, email list, or Discord community. It is through this persistent community that you can advertise ways to support and engage directly with the primary content creators by supporting through Patreon or viewing/subscribing on Twitch.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The platforms above can obviously be used for different purposes, but they’re segmented as such because of how their primary business models work. Discovery platforms run on ads and focus on getting you to consume more content. Engagement platforms are more personalized, with content not designed for larger audiences and frequently encourage users to take action. Activation platforms are designed to have monthly or direct recurring payment models that provide an enhanced or personalized version of Engagement content.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Going Live and Back Again</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">With a better understanding of the primary purposes of each platform, you can begin to design your user experience in a way that provides new community members an easy and direct way to participate in and show dedication to the community. Regardless of how your Twitch viewers discover your channel or content, directing them to a centralized community hub will allow them to share their appreciation with others, and go from being an individual fan to being part of a community. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To get the most out of Discord and encourage members to join your stream, spend time with your community before and after each livestream. Before each stream, spend 15 minutes chatting with your active Discord members to ask them about their day or receive feedback about your content. As you begin your stream, post announcements on your social media platforms and use a bot to alert your Discord community that you’ve gone live. Moderators should continue to oversee discussions in your Discord, but encourage members to watch the livestream as it occurs. Bots and scripts can also be used to remind users to join the Discord community if they haven’t already, as well as following on social media for updates and alerts. Finally, as your stream is ending, remind the community that you’ll be available in Discord for a short time to discuss the stream and answer any questions. Some streamers will also include special events for high-ranking members or subscribers, which can help encourage collaboration and active use of the server.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Playing with Viewers via Discord</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the most effective ways to engage directly with your community is to create content with them. This can either be done while livestreaming, or else as a scheduled event that the community can participate in. Events need not necessarily be games, but can also include Q&amp;A sessions or discussions about a topic of interest. Special precautions must be made while playing with viewers as you’re live to prevent “stream sniping”, where community members will attempt to disrupt your stream or game while you’re live. Moderators should take note and be ready to handle disruptions while engaging directly with the community, but most situations can be prevented by assigning restrictions or requirements to be on stream with the host. For example, being a subscriber to the community or requiring participants to apply for a spot if the game has a limited number of participants can help ensure everybody understands and follows the rules.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Discord for Twitch Checklist</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As you grow your Discord community, members will have different expectations of what your server offers, how it’s managed and what the server is used for. For example, a community with 500 members may not be expected to have a full events calendar, but they would definitely expect that roles have been properly configured so that subscribers appear as a different username color with more permissions and access to restricted channels. Below is a simple checklist for the functionality your server should have:</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Milestones for 50 Members</span></h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Establish basic Discord functionality on your server. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Early on your Discord community may only have a few channels, but setting the correct discussion channels and role permissions early will help to prevent rule violations and problems as your community grows.

The subscription status and emotes can be synced to your Discord automatically through an Oauth integration, allowing you to provide custom subscriber-only channels to reward loyalty. Learn more in the support center about </span><a href=\\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/212112068-Twitch-Integration-FAQ\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Twitch Integration</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Configure your Announcement Bots. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While the use of bots for such a small community may seem unnecessary, having your Stream Announcement bots configured as soon as possible will help your Twitch channel grow exponentially. You can have two bots that fulfill this role, bots in Discord to announce Go-Live streams and bots on Twitch to offer invitation links to Discord.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Milestones for 500 Members</span></h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Regular News and Announcements. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once you have a larger and more active community consider doing regular posts featuring content released on other platforms like YouTube or information about changes and updates to the community. Many popular Discord bots offer custom alert notifications to encourage your community to load your livestream as you begin streaming. Several Twitch bots also allow for commands you can use to drive traffic to your Discord community.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Bot Automation for Modding and Common Questions. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While small communities can be easily modded by a few individuals, larger communities require automated tools to delete posts and enforce the rules. Bots can be used to detect and remove spam, assign roles, kick and ban members or answer frequently asked questions using keyword detection.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Diversified Discussion and Call channels. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As your community grows, new discussion and call channels should be created to allow multiple discussions to occur simultaneously. For example, assigning custom channels for promotion, media or other discussion topics help make content in your community easier to find and filter. Create two or more voice channels to allow for serious versus casual discussion and limit the number of active chatters to ensure the call doesn’t become too noisy.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Milestones for 5000 Members</span></h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Scheduled Events and Community Activities. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As your community grows into the thousands, enough members will be active that you can begin hosting events or activities related to the core theme or value proposition your community offers. These events would be posted as part of your community announcements and may offer a custom role to keep regulars active and informed about similar events. A system that allows community members to create their own events can assist in offloading work and planning from the moderation team, and empower your members to build a stronger culture within the community.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">\\n<strong>Advanced Functionality Scripts. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Finding a skilled developer to create custom bots and scripts for the community will open up new opportunities for what your members can accomplish on your platform. For example, modular discussion and voice channels can allow community members to temporarily create their own call or discussion channels for an activity. These channels can last a certain amount of time or automatically delete themselves once everyone has left, ensuring the total number of channels and messages in the community isn’t overwhelming.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We hope these guidelines have helped you to determine if creating a Discord server for your Twitch audience is the right fit for you. The most essential thing to keep in mind is that your Discord server is not just an appendix to your Twitch presence. It serves as its own entity and community that needs to be fostered with the same, if not more, personal attention and care in order for it to blossom. With the right mindset and efforts, your Discord community can bolster your Twitch presence and bring your community closer together, for longer.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>"')

One great feature that is often overlooked by moderators is webhooks, which can prove to be incredibly powerful when implemented well, especially for server automation. In this article we will be introducing webhooks, exploring how they work, and how they compare to bots in addition to going over some of the best practices when utilizing webhooks in the context of moderation on Discord.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Before we begin, we highly recommend you check out the </span><a href=\\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Intro to Webhooks</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> article published by Discord.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What is a Webhook?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A webhook is sort of a “reverse API”: rather than an application you own (like a bot) calling another application to receive data when it wants it, a webhook is something you can give to someone else\'s application to send data to </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">you</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> directly as soon as there’s something to share. This makes the process very convenient and efficient for both providers and users.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now let’s apply this definition to a more tangible example. Let’s say you aren’t around to reply to new e-mails for a while. Through the power of webhooks you could have a setup that replies automatically! When an event happens on a service (like receiving an email), that service activates your webhook and sends you the data relevant to the event that happened. That way, you have exactly the information you need to automatically reply to each new e-mail you receive.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">So what does this mean for your server? Basically, Discord provides you with the ability to have a webhook that sends a message to your server when it’s activated, with the option to send the message to any channel along with having a cool name and avatar of your choice. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, let’s say you’re waiting for the latest chapter of your favorite webcomic series to release. You can set up a webhook that’s connected with an RSS feed. The feed will activate the webhook when the chapter is released and a message will be posted on your server to notify you about it. This can be applied to many different things - the potential is limitless!</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If the service is capable of sending JSON Webhooks, Discord can often use these to create visually appealing embeds when it sends a message out. However, it can also accept raw text messages to pass along as well.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Usage of Webhooks</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Webhooks are a great tool for services that have events that you’re interested in latching onto. This can be incredibly useful for Content Creator communities where their latest YouTube videos or Twitter posts can be funneled into channels for followers to have easy viewing access in your Discord community. You could also use this for a community that’s oriented towards an open-source technology by having events from GitHub be submitted directly to your server for people to keep track of.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are a lot of platforms out there that provide you with the ability to handle everything by yourself- from creating the Webhook through your Discord Server Settings to plugging it into the platform you want updates from. However, this often requires you to be more familiar with at least </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">some</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> level of programming as many of these platforms require developer accounts. There can be a few hoops to jump through to get everything set up just right. This can often turn people off from using these types of webhooks.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">However, times are changing and the barrier to entry when dabbling into the world of webhooks is much lower. These days, multiple third-party services exist that have handled all the hard techy stuff for you. They can interface with the platforms that would normally require you to do extra work to get the data you want. </span><a href=\\"https://ifttt.com/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">IFTTT</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and </span><a href=\\"https://zapier.com/how-it-works\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Zapier</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> are two such services that lets you plug-and-play several useful platforms directly into your Discord server through a clean web interface that allows you to customize the type of data your webhook receives, and thus what messages are sent to your server. Just keep in mind that some services have restrictions on how many events can be sent to one webhook, so you may have to create multiple distinct webhooks for multiple functionalities. Note that these options and restrictions are entirely platform-dependent. Discord has no problems handling whatever data is thrown at its webhooks when activated, even if it’s from different sources.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There’s another use-case for Webhooks that is more unique. While they’re very useful for automated messages, they’re also great for one-off embed messages that have a very polished look! You have the ability to customize the name and the avatar of the webhook, but if you’re technologically-inclined you can create your own JSON data to activate the webhook with. This allows you to fully define the aesthetics of an embed in your message, giving a clean look to whatever information you’re sending. One possible application is nice formatting for your server rules and information, rather than just sending multiple plain text messages. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Of course, there are other possible uses, the only limit is your creativity! If you’re not too keen on developing JSON data by hand, or have no idea what a “JSON” is, services like </span><a href=\\"https://discohook.org/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discohook</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> also make it easy for anyone to take advantage of this use case. As a note, </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">t</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">he websites linked here are not endorsed by Discord and are only a suggestion from the authors of the article.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How do I set up a webhook?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The process of setting up webhooks can be roughly explained in five simple steps!</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Step 1: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In your Discord server, you will need to create a webhook and copy the webhook URL. This URL is the path for your webhook to receive an HTTP POST request from a service when an event occurs.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Step 2: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">From this menu, you have the ability to style your webhook with a name and avatar. We recommend at least a name to distinguish its purpose.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Step 3: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you’re using a third-party service to handle events or send messages, plug your webhook URL into the service and configure the type of events that the service should trigger for.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Step 4: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If your third-party service allows you to, configure additional options that will change the look and content of your message to the way you like.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>Step 5: </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now that you’ve created the connection, when the event happens, the data will be sent directly to Discord and your webhook will post a message in your preferred channel!</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What is an Embed?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We’ve been talking about embeds a lot, but we haven’t quite explained what they are yet! In simple terms, embedding refers to the integration of links, images, GIFs, videos and other forms of content into messages on social media. An embed itself is a part of the message that visually represents content in order to increase engagement.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As a user of Discord, you have probably seen embeds more than a few times. They often are created automatically by Discord when a user sends a link, such as allowing you to view a YouTube video within Discord when a YouTube URL is shared. But did you know that Discord Bots and Webhooks can create their own embeds with all kinds of data? They’re pretty flexible! They can have colored borders, images, text fields, and other kinds of fancy properties.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you\'re a developer, the options available to you to create a good-looking embed are powerful and versatile. For non-developers, platforms may give you visualizations that help you plug-and-play data into a website for customization purposes. There are also online tools to help you do this too!</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Here are several of those properties that can be modified in an embed in order to style it, to give you an idea of what’s possible when you have the ability to style your messages:</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<table>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Element</span></p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Description</span></p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Title</span></p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The text that is placed above the description, usually highlighted.

They have a single function, which is to send a designated message when they are activated.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Versatility. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Webhooks have many different use cases, all stemming from being able to send a message upon activation. This allows for many types of automation powered by other services, or allows you to send clean looking messages manually. Both of these setups have their own various uses ranging from posting updates and logging to posting custom messages for an aesthetic purpose. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Automation. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">With webhooks, there isn’t a need to constantly look for updates and post them yourself. Once set up, a webhook will automatically post any updates you need.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Customization. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Each webhook can have a unique name and avatar, and each message it sends can be unique as well. You can have multiple webhooks with different looks in different channels and use each of them however you like.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Accessibility. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once you create a webhook, all you need is its URL and a website that will push messages. Since these webhooks are hosted on Discord, they don’t need to be hosted like a normal bot, often saving moderation teams from encountering a financial investment to use them, and making them more easily available to all users.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Webhooks vs. Bots</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Webhooks and bots, while having slight similarities, are actually very different from each other.

Sometimes, bots and webhooks work their best when working together. It’s not uncommon for bots to use webhooks for logging purposes or to distinguish notable messages with a custom avatar and name for that message. Both tools are essential for a server to function properly and make for a powerful combination. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Thanks to their simplicity and accessibility, webhooks have become a staple in many communities. Despite their limitations and lack of functions compared to bots, they’re still very useful  and play an important role in the automation and decoration of your server. Overall, webhooks are a great tool for pushing various messages, with limitless customization opportunities. Ultimately, the choice of using them depends solely on your needs and preferences. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Getting a community off the ground can be a daunting task, so it may come as no surprise that some communities will want to band together. This is where “partnering” comes in: to put it simply, partnering is when communities promote each other in order to not only boost awareness of the existence of each community, but also to drive new traffic to those places. Partnering can also help communities thrive by sharing users with common interests. And it can even be used for moderation purposes!</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Note</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">: in this context the term “partnering” is different from the </span><a href=\\"https://discord.com/partners\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord Partner Program</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. The kind of partnering that is being referred to is when two communities enter an agreement to work together. While the </span><a href=\\"https://discord.com/partners\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord Partner Program</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> is a program for large community-led servers that are the best-of-the-best that Discord has to offer. Moving forward in this article, anytime “partnering” is referred to it is with this definition in mind. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Why partner with other communities?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are many different reasons why one community may want to partner with another. The most common reason is that communities</span> <span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">that are similar may want to share their user-base with one another. In theory, this strengthens both communities, but it can have negative consequences, which will be discussed later. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Another reason for partnering may be for</span> growth purposes<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. For instance, community A may want others to know about them, and thus partners with community B. In this scenario community A gets promoted in community B, and community B </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">also </span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">gets promoted in community A. This is mutually beneficial, but can have negative consequences if not done properly that will be touched upon shortly.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Communities may also want to partner up if they share a </span>common interest<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. For example, LGBTQ+ communities may partner together because they share a common goal and have overlapping user bases. This kind of partnership not only helps to promote both communities, but also helps the users that are in both communities find spaces for them. For example, a user may join a general purpose LGBTQ+ community, but they may want to also be in a more specific community that is </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">also </span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">LGBTQ+ focused, such as one based around an LGBTQ+ book club for those who are readers.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Usually when partnering with another community you will want to include a few basic details in any partnership announcements including</span> <span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">a description of the community you’re partnering with, a reminder to follow rules/guidelines of the community, a way to join the community in question, and possibly</span> <span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">some information of what the community entails such as their unique emotes or the interesting events they run. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">These details will help show users that you aren\'t partnering with another server to simply promote, but that you are instead invested in the community itself and think that this partnership will strengthen your community</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. Sharing these details allows you to be transparent with your community, but also gives users a reason to join the community you’re partnered with.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What does a Partnership look like? </span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are a few different ways communities can show off a partnership with another community.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For communities with multiple partner servers, creating a channel specifically to share information about partners is likely ideal. These are often simply called #partners or #community-partners.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> <img class=\\"HiaYvf-SmKAyb\\" draggable=\\"false\\" src=\\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4PbK9YeOBd2wg7xrTNOVvpLDZ1WlxJYrixepbvAkEh8PZddwOHvN4xTDdZJLllnaNSAFDodgGYGCghQ5RWO5pvjHLGodFdU3sDEkNnCs3jCZGwJCBJHMSB1Xo4bDVIVUEwVFiEQ\\"></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A more direct way to share news would be to make an announcement that lets your community know that a partnership is in effect.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\\"><img class=\\"HiaYvf-SmKAyb\\" draggable=\\"false\\" src=\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/keep-bbsk/AGk0z-ObpFqUSRMvMtlmI1bbiKUk9cJipvY8tyshSYv4Gfjdih3WDisUFS65Q3evNXDDppOIMcg95XwiQypSAXSfiWJRGbXYYVLylXYHcDk\\" width=\\"570\\" height=\\"305\\"></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A third option for sharing news of partnership is by utilizing “Invasive Advertising” which is a method of advertising that is invasive by design. From the name, it is easy to understand why this method is often discouraged due to its widespread dislike by users and tendency to hurt partnerships. Usually this kind of partnership takes place in the DM’s of users. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><img class=\\"HiaYvf-SmKAyb\\" draggable=\\"false\\" src=\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/keep-bbsk/AGk0z-PCnYeNCRQ-ECwZ67ooEPxQh9jxx_HL85lZaLTx5tlggM5yGFLZvvPU2JQgPMbvYeHZU4kdmT7KDf8Z_b9Nw1uZydWwQtfF5aiqdrc\\"></span></p>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For example, a user may join a community and at the instant they join, a bot will DM them with information about a particular partnership. This is regarded as spammy and is disliked by most on Discord, and it may be against the Terms of Service since it can be investigated as a form of spam, platform abuse, or general inauthentic behavior that undermines the way Discord was intended to be used. For this reason, we recommend not utilizing this form of partnership because it can be a hindrance in cultivating trust in new members and a healthy partnership program. This form of promotion is useful for large and ever-growing community networks, so an option to consider could be to allow users to opt-in to a bot who can share news of similar communities in DMs as opposed to forcing it onto everyone. Otherwise, we recommend that it is better to keep news of partnerships in announcement based channels in your server and not in DMs.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Evaluating Partnership Health</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Sometimes partnerships can turn sour. This can include not seeing many users join from the partnered community, the partnered community no longer upholding similar standards to what you hold your own community to, or toxic users joining from a partnered community. It is important to consider all of these things before starting a partnership and keeping them in mind as your partnership continues.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">So, what happens if you don’t see many users joining from a partnered community? There are a few ways to gauge how many people are joining from the community. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The first is word of mouth - ask new users where they came from. The second and probably most prevalent is creating unique invite links or other such tracking methods to see where users are coming from. This is seen as the best way to gauge new user traffic as it is something that does not require direct input and it is something that can be looked at in a graph or data analysis tool if you are so inclined.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Unrelated to data analysis, but just as important, are the users that are coming from a partnered community. If the users coming from a partnered community are rude, rule-breaking, or otherwise toxic, then there may be a problem. The best way to prevent this is to watch the community that you want to partner with </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">before</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> partnering with it. You may also want to talk with the staff of the community and see what they tolerate and do not tolerate. This is the best way to familiarize yourself with the community before partnering, though it isn’t foolproof and of course issues may still arise. If the user base does turn out to be toxic, it may be best to terminate the partnership and go your separate ways.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It’s also important to ensure that the communities you are partnered with are maintaining environments that align with how you maintain your own server. Should that change, it may not make sense for you to continue a partnership. For example, it does not make sense for a family friendly space to partner with a server that isn’t family friendly. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In another instance, if you see the staff of a partnered community not adhering to rules you hold your own staff to that can be harmful, you can also break a partnership as it can begin to affect their users negatively as well. Let’s say you are cultivating a positive environment, but you see the staff of a partnered community actively participating in negative discussion of other communities with their users- you have every right to end a partnership to avoid being associated with that and to show you do not endorse it. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Private moderation partnerships</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A more niche type of partnership is the kind of partnership that is private and solely related to moderation between communities. This is where the staff teams of both communities will pool their resources and use them together to make sure that bad actors stay out of their respective communities. This is usually a mutually beneficial partnership, as both communities will gain knowledge and resources. For instance, </span><strong>Community A</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> may have spammers joining daily and spamming their community, so they will give the relevant information to the community they are partnered with (</span><strong>Community B</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">).With this preemptive data, Community B will be able to ban or otherwise deal with the spammers before they start becoming an issue. This benefits Community B and shows that Community A is interested in helping Community B, which builds trust between the communities.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Bots are a unique benefit to this kind of partnership. Bots are typically used to help communities pool things like ban lists or information centered around problematic users. A shared moderation bot can allow certain actions, such as spam related bans to be logged in both communities. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Likewise, if one community has cultivated a list of toxic or otherwise problematic users that are in their community, this list would be available for both communities to share and reference. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Something important to keep in mind in this type of partnership is that the moderators of any server should have the final say before a user (or group of users) are banned or otherwise reprimanded. This allows the moderators to look at all the information and ask for more info if needed, but nothing is acted on without knowledge being shared.</span></p>\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Community partnerships can be wonderful tools to enrich multiple communities. Partnerships can be used for the purpose of creating a network of communities, or even for private moderation-related matters. If done correctly, communities working together can get a lot done and create a better experience for their respective users.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>"')

User B perceives User A as very relatable through common interests or behaviors and starts to develop a feeling of loyalty, or even responsibility, during that phase of one-sided bonding. This behavior can be attributed to personal reflection in User A, as well as psychological facts like loneliness, empathy, or even low self-esteem. As a consequence, User B can easily be influenced by User A.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">At this point User B might feel like they understand User A in a way nobody else does and may even begin to view them on a personal level as some sort of friend or close relative. They see this individual every day, hear their voice on a regular basis, and believe that they are connecting to them on a deep level. They develop an emotional attachment, and the stronger the parasocial relationship gets, the more attention User B pays to User A’s behavior and mannerisms. While User A most likely doesn’t know User B personally, User B will seek out interaction with and recognition from User A. That behavior is typically represented through donations on stream, where User A either reads out their personal message and name or publishes a “thank you” message on certain websites. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Additionally, User B tries to follow and engage with their idol on as many platforms as possible aside from their main source of content creation. These social media platforms are usually Instagram or Twitter, but can also include User A’s Discord server.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Levels of Parasocial Relationships</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While that type of relationship is natural and sometimes even desired, it is important to define the level of parasocial relationships and differ between its intensity for the safety of the community, the staff members, and the performer. In their article in the Psychology focused academic journal ‘The Psychologist’, researchers </span><a href=\\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242475256_Praying_at_the_altar_of_the_stars\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Giles and Maltby</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> designed three levels of severity of parasocial relationships based on the </span><a href=\\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/npb/people/jm148/scales/celebrity-attitude-scale\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Celebrity Attitude Scale</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Entertainment-Social</span></h4>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">“Fans are attracted to a favourite celebrity because of their perceived ability to entertain and to become a source of social interaction and gossip. Items include ‘My friends and I like to discuss what my favourite celebrity has done’ and ‘Learning the life story of my favourite celebrity is a lot of fun’.”</span></em></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The least harmful level is the general public and social presence. The targeted celebrity is subjected to gossip and mostly provides a source of entertainment. Their presence is mostly found in talks with friends, talk shows, on magazine covers, and similar public-facing media. Discord users on this level usually interact with the community in a relaxed, harmless way. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Intense-Personal</span></h4>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The next level is parasocial interaction. The characteristics of this level are the development of an emotional attachment of a spectator with a performer, resulting in intense feelings. This behavior is characterized by the spectator wanting to get to know the performer, followed by the desire to be part of their life as well as considering them as part of their own life. A result of that can be addictive or even obsessive behavior, which can be noticed in Discord servers, too. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">“The intense-personal aspect of celebrity worship reflects intensive and compulsive feelings about the celebrity, akin to the obsessional tendencies of fans often referred to in the literature. Items include ‘My favourite celebrity is practically perfect in every way’ and ‘I consider my favourite celebrity to be my soulmate’.”</span></em></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Spectators of that level usually ping the performer or message them privately in an attempt to be recognized. While that behavior is natural, anything that endangers safe interactions between themselves, the community, or the performer needs to be supervised carefully. Unrestrained abusive behavior, which can be found in unwanted intimate, borderline NSFW questions or comments, needs to be addressed and corrected accordingly.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Borderline-Pathological</span></h4>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The final level is considered the most intense level and also the most dangerous. It contains severe, harmful obsessions that can extend all the way to stalking and real-world consequences. Parasocial relationships to this degree will rarely be found on Discord, but have to </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058643194\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">immediately be reported if present</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">“This dimension is typified by uncontrollable behaviours and fantasies about their celebrities. Items include ‘I would gladly die in order to save the life of my favourite celebrity’ and ‘If I walked through the door of my favourite celebrity’s house she or he would be happy to see me’.”</span></em></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The vast majority of users won’t reach the level past seeing the performer as a source of entertainment, but moderators should be aware of potential consequences of anything beyond that as they can be harmful to both the spectator, the performer, and the safe environment you are working to upkeep for all.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Parasocial Relationships on Discord</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Parasocial relationships on Discord can pertain to anyone who is perceived as being popular or influential, making them “celebrities” of Discord. Some examples of parasocial relationships on Discord can be found between a user and a moderator, a user and a content creator you are moderating for, or even a member of your moderation team and the content creator you are working for.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Between a User and Yourself</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">But what does all that mean for you, the mod? While Discord moderators are not nearly as popular and influential as big content creators or celebrities, they are still observed by Discord users. While being a moderator puts you into a position of power and responsibility over the wellbeing of the server, some users perceive it as you climbing the social ladder in the Discord server. In their eyes, becoming a moderator changes your overall social status within your Discord community. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Being hoisted higher in the servers’ hierarchy results in members quickly recognizing you and potentially treating you differently due to your influence, even becoming “fans” of you as a person. Some users will soak up any information they can get about you, especially if they realize that you have common interests. This may lead to the development of a parasocial relationship between users and you. Users you have never interacted with before might see you as a person they would get along with and seek out your attention, leading to a one-sided relationship on their part.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Having such an audience can be overwhelming at first. People will start to look up to you, and younger users especially can easily be influenced by online personas. They might adapt to your behavior or even copy your mannerisms. Knowing that, you should always be self-aware of your actions and etiquette in public to promote a healthy, sustainable relationship with the users. Receiving special attention from users can quickly influence and spiral into developing an arrogant, or entitled attitude. There is nothing wrong with being proud of your position and accomplishments, but being overtly arrogant will influence a members’ behavior towards you. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The mindset of one user deciding a moderator is not being responsible can spread through the community in negative ways. They might belittle you in front of new members and give them the feeling that you won’t be there to help them or might not inform you of ongoing problems on the server during a temporary absence of moderators in the chat. A healthy user-moderator relationship is important to prevent or stop ongoing raids as well as make moderators aware of a user misbehaving in chat.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Additionally, it’s important to be mindful that your perceived fame does not start to negatively influence your judgment. For example, you may find yourself giving special attention to those who seem to appreciate you while treating users that are indifferent towards your position as a moderator more harshly. It also causes the dynamics within the staff team to change as fellow moderators might start to perceive you differently if you begin to allow bias to seep into moderation. They may start to second guess your decisions, feel the need to check up on your moderator actions, or even lose trust in your capabilities. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you ever notice that you experience said effect, or notice one of your fellow moderators is experiencing it and letting it consume them, be supportive and sort out the negative changes. When confronting another moderator about it, make sure to do it through constructive criticism that doesn’t seem like a personal attack.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In spite of that, the effects of parasocial relationships don’t always have to be negative in nature. If users manage to build such a connection to a moderation team, the general server atmosphere can grow positively. Users know what moderators like and don’t enjoy, which will lead them to behave in a way that appeals to staff and usually abides by the server rules. They will also be able to predict a moderators’ reaction to certain behavior or messages new people might use. As a result, they will attempt to correct users that are mildly misbehaving themselves without getting staff involved immediately in hopes of receiving positive feedback from staff. Naturally, moderators won’t be able to know of every single person that tries to appeal to them through those actions, but once they are aware that such things happen in certain text channels, it will give them the opportunity to focus on other channels and provide their assistance there.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Between a User and a Content Creator</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As mentioned before: In the case of content creators who frequently upload videos, streams, and other forms of media for their followers, the chance of a parasocial phenomenon being developed can be even greater. This will only intensify by joining a creators’ Discord server. This can be done under the false assumption that there will be a higher chance of their messages being read and noticed. Your responsibility as a moderator is to neither weaken that bond nor encourage it while providing security for users, staff, and the content creator. Let the users interact in a controlled environment while maintaining the privacy of the content creator.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some users might even feel like the content creator owes them some sort of recognition after long-term support, both through engagement or donations. Such a demand can be intensified when they’re shown as “higher” in the hierarchy through dedicated Discord roles, such as </span><a href=\\"http://dis.gd/dma453\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Patreon</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">/Donator or simple activity roles. In the case of multiple people building a parasocial relationship with the same content creator and experiencing that phenomenon, they may see other active users or even moderators as “rivals.” They see the content creator as a close friend in their eyes and feel threatened that others, especially those that financially support the content creator, perceive them the same or think they are even closer to them. During such moments, it is recommended to keep the peace between users and let them know that the content creator appreciates every fan they have. While the ones providing financial support are appreciated, every viewer is what makes the creator as big as they are and played a part in getting them to where they are today.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Between a Moderator and a Content Creator</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Maybe it won’t only be the user that feels closer to them by joining the server. Many beginner moderators may also find themselves feeling as though they are above the rest of the community because their idol has entrusted them with power on their server. Being closer to them than most of the users can easily fog your judgement; it is essential to prioritize being friendly and respectful to the users over these personal convictions. When adding moderators to your moderation team, it is important to keep an eye out for this kind of behavior to combat it, and to hold your teammates accountable should you see this behavior begin to exhibit in one of your teammates. Making sure your entire team is on the same page regarding your duties and standing in the community is essential to maintaining a healthy moderation environment. As a moderator for a Content Creator, this individual you may admire deeply has put their trust in you to keep their community safe. Falling into the machinations of developing an unhealthy parasocial relationship with them directly interferes with your ability to do that, failing not only the community but the creator. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Despite the potential dangers from parasocial relationships, the fact that they develop at all may indicate that you are doing a good job as a moderator. While positive attention and appreciation are key factors to a healthy development, not everyone may like that sort of attention and it is completely acceptable to tell your fellow moderators or even the users themselves about it. At one point you might feel like you reached your limit and need a break from moderation and managing parasocial relationships aimed at you and those around you. </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058645534\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">Moderator burnout </a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">is very real, and you should not hesitate to take a break when you need it. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Users will view you, as a moderator, as a leader that helps guide your designated Discord server in the right direction. As such, you will be a target for rude comments by users that have personal issues with the server while simultaneously getting showered with affection by other users who are thankful for what you do for the server. Never be afraid to ask for help and rely on the moderation team if things go too far for your personal boundaries or comfort level, even if you are an experienced moderator. Establishing a healthy relationship with the community is important, but being able to trust your fellow staff members is even more so. Nobody expects you to build an intimate relationship with every member, but knowing you can count on them and their support is essential for the team to function correctly.</span></p>"')

However, while moderating a server you may come across situations where you are unsure of whether you should make a report or not. This article will give you a good idea of what sorts of things are reportable, and what things are not worth reporting. Knowing this will help you decide what content needs to be moderated by your moderation team, and what content should be escalated to Trust &amp; Safety. Wherever it is mentioned that an issue should be handled on a server level, it is for the most part implied, but not required, that the server should consider punishing users who participate in the given behavior. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you do not know how to properly report content to Discord, see </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058643194\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">article 104, which explains it in detail</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord Community Guidelines - A Breakdown</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The </span><a href=\\"https://dis.gd/guidelines\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord Community Guidelines</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> may seem to indicate exactly what content you should report to Trust &amp; Safety, but interpretation of the rules may not always be that simple. The Community Guidelines are shown below with an explanation on when it is appropriate to report the situations described by each of the 18 guidelines in gray.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Here are some rules for interacting with others:</span></h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Do not organize, participate in, or encourage harassment of others.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Disagreements happen and are normal, but continuous, repetitive, or severe negative comments may cross the line into harassment and are not okay.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ol><ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"2\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Disagreements, insults, and other rude or disrespectful behavior is common, and should generally be handled in accordance with your own server rules. Usually these situations can be resolved with proper moderator action from server staff or asking victims to block offending users. However, if all possible measures have been taken on a server and user level to stop the behavior, and the behavior persists, (e.g., by means of ban evasion and alt account creation) then a Trust &amp; Safety report is warranted (see guideline four).</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Do not organize, promote, or coordinate servers around hate speech.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> It’s unacceptable to attack a person or a community based on attributes such as their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, or disabilities.</span>\\n</li>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"2\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If a user is participating in any of these actions aimed at another person or community, it is usually reportable. Some examples of usage of hate speech or slurs that should not be reported are meta talk about hate speech/slurs or relevant quotes containing hate speech/slurs. These situations are up to the server to moderate as you see fit.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Do not make threats of violence or threaten to harm others.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> This includes indirect threats, as well as sharing or threatening to share someone’s private personal information (also known as doxxing).</span>\\n</li>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"2\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If a user is at risk due to a threat made by another user, they should be reported. If the threat seems immediate, the affected user should call their local authorities and escalate the issue to law enforcement along with being reported. It is important to recognize, however, when a threat may not be truly dangerous. Users may joke about this topic, and mean no real harm. It is your job as a moderator to communicate with those involved to determine if a user is truly in danger.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Do not evade user blocks or server bans.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Do not send unwanted, repeated friend requests or messages, especially after they’ve made it clear they don’t want to talk to you anymore.

Users who evade a block or ban and do not continue bad behavior should not be reported, but you may choose to discipline users who do so on a server level if you prefer. The differentiation here is determining if their actions are maliciously directed towards others.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Do not send others viruses or malware</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, attempt to phish others, or hack or DDoS them.</span>\\n</li>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"2\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Viruses, malware, and phishing attacks are reportable as this content is directly against Discord’s Community Guidelines.

This is most commonly done in DMs.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">User Advertisements/Solicitations - Users can be reported for advertising and soliciting in DMs as well. However, if a user is advertising in a server, they should be dealt with on a server level, provided they are not advertising something that breaks another community guideline.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord Nitro Scams - Any scams being spread about getting free Discord Nitro or server boosts should be reported if they contain a potentially malicious link, or if being spread by a bot. If you see any messages that claim to give users Discord Nitro or server boosts through other means, such as putting a command in the console, you may handle those cases on a server level. It is recommended, however, that you remove these messages swiftly, as it is likely a ploy to get users to reveal their account token, which can give other users access to their account.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Chain Mail - You may encounter messages that are created to scare users and spread rapidly. Common phrases in these messages are \\"Look out for Discord user ____\\" or anything claiming a user or bot might DDoS you or steal your IP. These messages will usually say they were written by Discord as a scare tactic. This is not true. </span><strong>Any important messages from Discord will be posted on their social media, or in a system message and nowhere else.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> System messages are identifiable by the system tag (<img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4405230543255/mceclip0.png\\" alt=\\"mceclip0.png\\"></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">) seen next to the user that sends them. Any chain mail sent is not reportable, but should be dealt with on a server level. It is recommended that you delete these messages and inform users that they are fake.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This is not an exhaustive list of the situations you may encounter as a moderator, nor is it a guide for what rules you should enforce on your server, as the platform is ever-evolving. You may enforce extra rules as you see fit in order to cultivate the type of community you want for your server.

However, integral to being able to continue to grow your server is the understanding that you need to report and remove content that breaks Discord’s Community Guidelines from your server as necessary.

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord Moderators exist on every Discord server in different forms. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">With the constant growth of Discord as a whole (and as a direct result, servers on Discord), moderators’ roles have grown in importance and necessity in the pursuit of keeping chat flowing and providing users with an enjoyable but safe environment on their server. But what does it really mean to “moderate” a server? What are things you should be aware of when applying for a moderation position? Here is a step by step guide to understand the role.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What it means to be a Discord Moderator</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A community thrives in a healthy, comfortable and safe environment - and that\'s where moderation comes into play. Being a moderator means more than just being hoisted at the top of the server and having a fancy color. I</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">t is your responsibility to prevent and resolve conflicts between users, ensure the server is safe and free from potential harm, and set an example for the rest of the community to the best of your abilities.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While bigger servers may be less lenient when it comes to second chances, banning people over minor infractions may not always be the best approach. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Your responsibility is not just to execute punishments, but also to weigh</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> out the severity of the infraction. Moderating larger or more active communities can be overwhelming at first, so don’t be afraid to ask fellow moderators for help, and take their advice on improving your methods of moderation. While moderating, always be friendly and ready to help users in public. Find a balance between enforcing the rules, while also fostering a healthy relationship with users. “Aggressive” moderators tend to intimidate or scare off new users, which will harm your community. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As a moderator you will be the first point of contact for newer users, meaning people will seek out your attention or ping you for multiple reasons. It might even happen that they develop a parasocial relationship, which you can read more about </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405230072215\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">here</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Just because you go into moderation knowing that it is a commitment doesn’t mean that it can’t be overwhelming at times. It is important to know that any contribution you make to your server and its members is appreciated, and that there are tools to help keep your workload under control.</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> You have a whole team behind you to rely on and communicate with, so don’t feel like you have to handle everything yourself.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Public Behavior</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is important to be aware of the fact that your public behavior in both servers you moderate and other servers you’re a member of will affect how users perceive you as a moderator.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In the Servers You Moderate</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Having multiple permissions, </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405270345623\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">a special role color</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> meant to differentiate you, and power over users doesn’t mean you are freed from the servers’ rules or can act above them. Instead, you should encourage users to abide by the rules at all times while still being able to enjoy their stay on the server. Showing that you\'re dedicated to helping the server grow and by being an fair and trustworthy figure for the community goes a lot towards overall server morale. A key part of achieving this is to ensure you don’t do anything that would get normal users in trouble, i.e. flooding emojis or repeatedly writing in </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">capital letters only</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. Being extra mindful of the images you post and the things you say to ensure you never approach a “gray area” of breaking the rules will better help users understand how to behave in the server and contribute to the image of the moderation team being judicious and accountable.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderators are seen as role models for the server. That means that you should act maturely and set a good example for the community. That includes, but is not limited to, obscene behavior in both your messages and Discord profile: your picture, username, status, and linked socials are globally visible. Running a Discord server will result in members from different nationalities and backgrounds engaging in the community. Furthermore, in case of a dispute happening on the server, focus on the logic of the argument rather than the individuals involved. Fair and equal treatment for everyone should be the standard for moderation actions.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Nobody is perfect and nobody expects you to be perfect. However, when you find yourself in such an influential position, you need to have an open mind and learn how to accept constructive criticism. Making mistakes is understandable as long as you take responsibility for your actions and learn from them. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In other Servers</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While nobody can control what you do in private, you should always be mindful of your behavior in public servers. As a representative of your server, any inappropriate behavior in other communities will rebound if someone recognizes you and reports your irresponsible actions to your server staff. Remember that everything you share can reflect on your position and reputation.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">All of the above doesn’t imply that you should never freely talk to users - other servers allow you to let go of your moderator-persona and act casual without feeling responsible for the chat. As long as you follow the </span><a href=\\"https://discord.com/guidelines\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord Community Guidelines</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and the rules of the other communities you participate in while you are there, you won’t have any issues.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Engaging with Users</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">User engagement and activity is one of the essential aspects of running a Discord server successfully. In terms of smoothly conversing with a user, it is recommended to take the following points into account:</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Users New to Discord</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You should never assume that everyone knows how Discord works, or how your server operates. If there is the case that you come across a user who has multiple, seemingly “ridiculous” questions, don’t immediately assume they are a troll. There are many ways to get confused by things that may seem natural to superusers of the platform. Take your time to explain certain parts or functions of both Discord and the server you\'re moderating while keeping a friendly and inviting tone.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Users that are new to a community they aren’t experienced with may not know terms that are everyday words for active members. Abbreviations like LFG (looking for groups) in gaming communities, GFX (graphic effects) in art servers, and much more. When communicating with an inexperienced or intimidated user, ensure that you don’t sound rude because they are unfamiliar with the lingo. Try to guide them around the server without using confusing abbreviations and be patient as it may be their first time in those types of servers. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Communication</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Online communication cannot accurately convey our usual ways of expression: facial cues, emotions, physical gestures, and your vocal tone. This makes it easy for others to misinterpret your messages, and for you to misunderstand theirs. When reading and analyzing a message without those real-life factors, it often happens that our own emotions fill in those blanks and that misunderstanding encourages us to act in the heat of the moment. Before acting on negative emotions, give the other user the benefit of the doubt and calmly ask them for clarification on parts of their messages that upset you without being accusatory.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When sending messages, there are many ways to convey what you really want to express including emojis or other special symbols such as tonal indicators. Always make sure to read through your messages as a moderator and think “how could that be misunderstood in a way that it upsets someone?”, and adjust based upon that thought process. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Furthermore, you may encounter users whose first language isn’t your servers’ primary language. Even though a server rule states to speak in the designated language only, it’s usually not productive to immediately someone for violating that rule, especially if it’s their first post or two in the server. Start with a verbal warning with a reminder to stick to the server’s language rules. Also consider that while misspelling words may be a common way to avoid a bot’s filter, try to identify which part of the faulty spelling might be due to their poor language skills and be more lenient when it comes to taking action as a moderator in those circumstances.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">User Privacy</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It may happen that a friend of yours joins the server or you become close friends with fellow members or moderators on the server.Never post personal information about another server user without their explicit permission, even if it is meant in a joking way. Such information includes calling or identifying users by their real name, revealing their age, or where they reside. Let everyone explore or open up to the server and its community at their own pace. Only after that, with their consent, should you mention them by their name in public.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Engaging with Staff</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Teamwork makes the dream work and it is important to maintain a healthy, communicative, and respectful relationship with your moderation team to ensure easy moderation of your community.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Teamwork is Key</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When dealing with moderation issues, seeking help from fellow staff members always seems like optimal assistance. Getting another person’s opinion on a topic may help you to see things from a different angle, or reinforce your judgement. Taking everyone’s perspective into account can help you master even the most difficult problems and it takes weight off your shoulders to let other people know about your concern. You are part of a team, and do not have to act alone.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Respectful Treatment</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Another consideration when it comes to public appearance is respect for your fellow moderators. A successful staff team flourishes when all of its members work together. It is not expected of you to become the best of friends with every single staff member, but one thing you should never do is talk badly about fellow staff in public or do things you know will cause a bad reaction from their part. If you have any issue regarding them, you should address it in private or get your team’s upper management involved if there are more severe issues going on. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Staff Discretion</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The same can be said for general problems within the moderation team. Internal problems should stay internal. Keeping privacy about staff related matters does not equal to being absolutely exclusive. A certain level of transparency in moderation is always recommended (read more about that </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058646314\\" target=\\"_self\\">here</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">), and if a user has an inquiry about a punishment they received or wants to talk about something that happened in the server, they should never be shut down. The same goes for staff members: if they have questions about a moderation act, you should keep them up to date so they are informed in case new- but similar- issues arise.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Taking up the moderation mantle can be a very fulfilling duty. Being in such a position means you can help people in ways others cannot, and even the smallest “thank you” or a nice gesture of appreciation can brighten up your day. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When performing your duties as a moderator, remember to give everyone a fair and equal treatment. Approach users in a friendly way and never make them feel less validated for asking questions, even if they have been frequently asked. As a representative of your server, you have to interact with others in a respective manner, especially with users that are either new to Discord or don’t fluently speak your servers’ chosen language. When moderating, keep an open mind about everything and take context into account. Every situation is different. Be ready and willing to implement constructive feedback into how you approach moderation and own up to when you aren’t in the right. Sometimes things will go wrong or the road ahead may twist, but it’s crucial to remember that making mistakes is okay, as long as you take appropriate responsibility and grow from them. </span></p>\\n<p><br><br></p>"')

This is where </span><strong>engagement</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> comes into play.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Community engagement</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> is, simply put, the staff of a server engaging in certain actions to better communicate, and get more involved with the community in order to keep it active. It also includes directing users towards various activities in order to improve their communication with each other. It shows to your members how much you actually care for the community, as well as how willing you are to participate and improve your relations in it as a staff member. Additionally, these methods help you increase your personal contribution and your members’ contribution to the server, creating a stronger sense of unity in the process.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While this may sound somewhat complicated, it is actually quite simple to do, and eventually, will feel natural to how you run your community.

People usually join servers because they are seeking a community built around that purpose whether it be in pursuit of more knowledge about a certain topic or for befriending those with a shared interest. After all, a servers’ purpose is the main reason why members keep coming back to check the server and participate. As a staff member, it is your duty to help provide up to date information to your members as well as providing safe spaces for them to talk about it. By not keeping your members informed you may inadvertently exude the feeling that you don’t particularly care about the server topic and, consequently, the community itself.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Before we continue, we must define each of the terms mentioned in the heading of this section. Keep in mind that these are not strict dictionary definitions, but ones that are more fitting for the topic of managing a specific community as they cover the different messages a moderation team may share with their community.</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><strong>News</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> consists of recent updates regarding the focus topic of your server. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br><br></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some examples of newsworthy updates would be:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Posting about a release of a new episode in a server about a TV series.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Sharing a link to an article about something that happened in politics in a server about politics.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Highlighting the new class schedule in a server about your school.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Noting that there is an official outage affecting the game that a server is dedicated to.</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">These are short and simple posts that keep everyone informed about things regarding the main topic of the server. Posting news should almost always be done as soon as possible and without biased opinion. The posts in #News should not be meta- that is, about the running of the server itself and not the topic in specific.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Updates</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> are posts about changes in the server itself. This usually refers to changing rules, adding or removing channels, updating roles or permissions, and more. If it’s a change to a moderation system or the server itself, it is best to flag it for your users with an update post. These posts should always be short and comprehensive. It is very important for all your members to understand these changes so they don’t break rules after an update because they did not understand what you wrote. It also helps maintain transparency between the moderation team and the users.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Updates should be posted as soon as possible, but since you are the one deciding when they come out, you can time them in a way to post multiple updates in a single </span><strong>announcement</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> post.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Announcements </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">are usually larger posts that cover several updates and other server related things that you would like to post about on a larger scale. They should always contain information that is highly important to the community. Alternatively, they can be smaller in size if you’d like to post about one specific thing due to the timing of it, but be careful about which pings you use in that case. An example of this would be celebrating a server milestone by taking a look back on the history of the server, announcing new changes to accommodate growth, and sharing a giveaway in celebration of the new milestone all at once.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We recommend trying to keep these different types of posts organized into separate channels. This is done to avoid too much cluttering and makes things easier to find for both your moderation team and your members. Your larger posts, as well as server updates, should usually be focused into your main announcement channel. Having a separate channel for news is helpful for those using your community as an information source and not an engagement hub. Make any other announcement channels on a case-by-case basis. For example, if you host a large number of events, make a separate channel for event announcements. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Announcement drafting tips:</span></h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Keep your posts brief, but provide necessary detail.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Larger announcements should never be over 500-550 words long, unless it is extremely important.

Make sure not to use too many! </span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Disable auto-embed.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> If you have multiple links in your post, use the &lt;link&gt; format (replace the word link with the actual link you’re posting) to disable the auto-embed on that link. This will prevent cluttering below your post.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>\\n<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Usage of </span><strong>@everyone</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, </span><strong>@here</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, and other role pings</span>\\n</h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The usage of pings is usually implied for all announcements. What roles you will ping in your post depends on who the announcement is meant for. That being said, you should have a role for each ping you need. These roles should be listed visibly somewhere on the server and easily selectable or assignable. Having opt-in roles allows members to select what they want and don’t want to be notified about. For example: if you post a lot of announcements for a specific event- let’s say karaoke- make a karaoke role for the members who wish to be notified for it. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In the same sense, make a related news role for people who want to get notified about the news on the server. This especially applies if you have a large number of these posts coming out frequently, since not everybody likes getting pinged constantly.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The most important ping in the server would be </span><strong>@everyone. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This ping should only be used for large announcements and updates that do not happen very often. </span><strong>Do not use this ping unless it is about something extremely important for the server that everyone actually needs to see. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For a more time-sensitive ping that requires immediate attention of those actively present, we recommend using an </span><strong>@here</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> ping instead of an </span><strong>@everyone </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">ping. Overusing either of these pings will likely anger your community. However, it is important to note that most users do not like usage of these pings at all despite them being very necessary from a moderation standpoint, and such pings can often lead to a small group of users leaving the server whenever utilized. Do not allow this to deter you from their usage, this is only noted to help you determine necessary usage for </span><strong>@here</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and crucial usage for </span><strong>@everyone</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. As such, the larger your community, the less often you should seek to use these pings.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If used correctly, pings will keep people, both active and inactive, coming back to your server to check these posts. Keeping your community updated is always highly appreciated by the members and could increase server activity over time. However, it is also important to note that you should not be discouraged by some quieter members exiting the server in response to these pings.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Server Events</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Events are activities where both members and moderation staff socialize. What’s most important about the events is that everyone has fun! Usually you won’t see people communicating in multiple channels. Most users will focus their activity into one or two channels dedicated to the event. Events can serve as a way to bring users together in a single place that may dedicate their time within the server to different channels and allow them to meet new people. A user who only focuses on the creative channels in a server can quickly find themself befriending a bug hunter who mostly focuses on programming within the server, and bringing everyone together to have fun is what community events are all about!</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are a few things you should keep in mind when hosting an event:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Plan and announce the event ahead of time.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Make sure you know what kind of event you’re planning and let your members know in time to clear their schedules.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Be mindful of the time.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Take notice of what time your server is most active. Remember, not everyone lives in the same time zone. You should also prioritize evenings and weekends, because that’s when most people are actually available, but pick times that may allow international participation if possible. </span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Try to include a lot of people.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> This doesn’t only mean going for having a large number of participants, you need to think about what is accessible to most users. Not everyone can buy that expensive game you want to host a tournament for.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Watch the participant count.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Usually, your goal should be for your event to have as many participants as possible, but sometimes you can’t do that due to technical limitations. This is something you need to determine in advance and make clear in your announcement.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Utilize voice chat.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Voice channels are a great tool that can make hosting some events easier as it allows bonding between participants. Keep in mind that with an active voice chat comes the need for moderators for that voice chat, which you can learn more about how to tackle moderating voice channels </span><a href=\\"http://dis.gd/dma313\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">here</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. </span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Have fun! Really. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">That’s the entire point of having events! The easiest way to to bond and form meaningful connections between you and your community is to have a good time on the server with them. </span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">These are just some of the basic and simple things to get you started. For a more detailed guide to hosting events on Discord, see </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000179501\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">here</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Contests</span></h3>\\n<p><strong>Contests </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">are a good way of allowing your members to show off their skills. It’s a great way to give creators a platform to share their talents with the world. Contents can also allow participants to feel a sense of contribution to their community--a way for them to feel like they have done their part in building the server.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A great example of this would be art contents for emojis, profile pictures of self-hosted bots, the server icon, and even the server banner. Artists can give back to the community and gain exposure, and the community can show appreciation to artists. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">So what are the most important things to know when planning a contest?</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>What kind of contest is it?</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> It can be writing, artwork, making a meme, etc. There are plenty of options, so pick whichever one is suited best for your community.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Set up fitting rules.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Make sure contest rules reinforce the server rules, but are also keeping in mind various forms of art that can be considered for entry.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Decide on a voting system.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Many prefer to allow server members to vote. However, moderation intervention can occur for final say and if there is concern about something being turned into a popularity contest.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Create an incentive.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> People may not participate just because there’s a contest--a reward can keep them interested and incentivize participation.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Giveaways</span></h3>\\n<p><strong>Giveaways </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">are a great and simple way to reward your community. People always like free stuff, so you don’t even need an extra reason to justify hosting a giveaway outside of someone wanting to! </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One thing to keep in mind when hosting giveaways is </span><strong>transparency</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. One of the best ways to show that a giveaway is truly random is the utilization of a giveaway bot. There are a lot of bots out there that can fulfill this need, but here are a few to consider if you’d like to get started:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<a href=\\"https://giveawaybot.party/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Giveaway Bot</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Most commonly used bot for giveaways across Discord.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<a href=\\"https://elibot.gg/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Eli</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">  </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">- Primarily has other functions, but has a giveaway tool as well.</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<a href=\\"https://giveaways.mrkirby153.com/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Giveaways</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> - Very useful for large scale giveaways of over 5,000 participants.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Using bots allows your users to easily participate without questioning the authenticity of winner selection. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>What can I give away? </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Well, pretty much anything that is legal to give away to someone. Always be sure that you have the reward ready before hosting the giveaway. It really doesn’t matter how big your giveaway is. Even small things can make someone’s day better, like a custom role, a piece of art from a beloved community member, or a month of Discord Nitro! Try to keep things in digital format. Sending a physical object can be problematic and expensive due to communities being mostly international and also requires sharing of personal information that servers members of minors may not be comfortable with.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>When do I host my giveaway? </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Your moderation team and your server can host giveaways as often as you like. You don’t require an excuse to host a give, but any special celebration, such as a server member milestone or server birthday are common times for giveaways to pop up. If allowing a server member to host a giveaway, it is still the moderation team’s responsibility to ensure a smooth and scam-free giveaway experience for the winner.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Task Roles</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As you may know, not everyone is capable of contributing to the server through artistic methods like in the case of </span><strong>contests</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. Still, there are plenty of users in the server who are looking to contribute in different forms. By granting </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000176222\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">certain permissions to select roles</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, you can create an environment more suitable for this.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Task roles</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> are roles that have specific permissions granted to them pertaining to select tasks in the community. These permissions are for specified purposes other than moderation as it is still imperative to make sure you don’t give the wrong permissions to the wrong people.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Task roles</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> can be very handy when you have some sort of manual work that can only be done with certain permissions, but also when your staff team is shorthanded. It helps ease the load on your moderators, while allowing members to help with the server and work directly with the moderation team. Additionally, giving users some level of permissions helps close the “power gap” between staff and regular members. It shows people that there isn’t too much difference between the moderators and everyone else, aside from the workload and the hoisted role.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One of the most common examples of a </span><strong>task role </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">would be an Event Manager. These are users who organize events for the server. Staff can’t always set enough time aside to host events, and even if they could, they would run out of ideas at some point. Remember that you have a community with a certain number of people, who potentially have endless ideas on what events you can host. Allow these users to express their ideas and host them as well. Having multiple organizers, along with a staff member to oversee the schedule, can create a rotating event cycle that doesn’t place too much burden on any specific person.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you begin to utilize </span><strong>task roles</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> in your community, make sure that you carefully select those whom you are granting permissions to.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Suggestions and Feedback</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It’s important for the staff to show their trust in the community and allow them to give their honest opinions on server matters. Suggestions and feedback are a great way to achieve this. Just like with events, your members could potentially have endless ideas on how you can improve the server. Listening to your members matters. They’re the ones who make up your community, without them none of what you are doing would even be possible. That’s why having a channel for suggestions and feedback is helpful.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are a few thing to keep in mind when it comes to suggestions and feedback:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>The channel should be open to everyone. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To ensure full transparency, all server members should have the permission to read and write in the channel. In cases where you have to gate your server, try to make the channel at least readable for everyone.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Set specific rules for the channel.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> It should be very clear that it is not a place for memes or trolling, but for serious discussion. Inappropriate behavior should not be tolerated. Additionally, it should be kept strictly to server related matters.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Openly ask for feedback. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Use your position to actively ask for feedback, either through announcements or whichever other platform on the server. Inviting your members to do so shows them you are actually interested in what they have to say.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Stay open-minded.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> While not every idea may sound great in the beginning, given enough thought it could turn out pretty well. Always be open to compromise. Don’t simply dismiss things because they seem bad at first sight. Start a conversation about it and see where the idea is headed, it could actually be good.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Not every suggestion will be good. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Just because you should keep an open mind, does not mean that every suggestion will be good or accepted. Identifying good and bad ideas requires equal communication amongst the moderators and members of the server.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Be honest.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> When you are giving your decision on a matter, give a clear explanation why you made that decision. Honesty is the best policy, lying will only make members lose their trust in you.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Have a firm stance.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> When you come to a decision, try to make sure it’s the final one. Don’t simply change your mind on the first disagreement. Not everyone will always agree with your choice, but you still need to think of what’s best for the community as a whole.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Accept your mistakes. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Sometimes moderation teams will make a wrong decision. Rectify your decision, and then acknowledge what you did wrong and fix it. Being stubborn about it will only make things worse.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Be sure to make it clear that if people are uncomfortable with giving this feedback in an open channel setting that they can send their concerns via DMs or another private outlet of your choosing. Approach that feedback with the same points in mind. With all these points in mind, you should be able to maintain a healthy relationship with your members.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Talk in the Chat</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As simple as it may sound, this is one of the most effective ways of engaging with your community. While members join your server for its purpose, they often only actively chat and stay for the community itself. Moderators, as leaders of the community, should put their best foot forward by actively talking in the chat, both text and voice, themselves. This is the easiest way to showcase your care and interest. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As a moderator, it’s helpful to get to know your members. Befriend them, be open with them, have fun. When you get closer to your members, they will trust you more. Of course, as a leader, you need to lead by example for your community and show good behavior in chat. When it comes to the rules, it’s okay to be forgiving, but do not avoid dealing punishments for some offenses due to friendly bias. Present yourself as just another member of the community, but do not forsake your role as a moderator.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Another thing you should consider is having your direct messages open to your members. Sometimes they won’t be comfortable with saying something in a public chat. That’s why you need to give them an option to message you directly. Be willing to let members rely on you even when it comes to topics they don’t feel like talking about in public. This is a sign that you are trusted. </span>Do not misplace this trust<span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. Once it’s gone, it can be difficult to earn back.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You should also consider reaching out to your members personally when you feel something is wrong. They are an important part of your community, so show that you care. Sometimes this can have a great impact, not only on their time in your server, but their lives in general. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Casual chatter not only helps make your community more tight-knit, it also builds great relationships. What you may not realize is that you could be making some life-long friends in chat as a moderator, too.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are many different ways you can go about engaging with your community which makes it a fun and easy task for moderation teams. Open communication and consideration of users’ feelings will result in maintained trust in your moderation team and a healthy server environment. Every server is different and members require certain things from every moderation team, but communication is key to cultivating a positive space that can continue to thrive for years to come.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As a community grows, there will be a need to allow members of your community to report bad behavior and violations of the rules to your moderation team. There are a wide range of options to choose from, which will be covered in this article. The list of tools is non-exclusive as you might want to combine multiple reporting options for your users to best suit your needs. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Importance of Reporting Tools</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Every community can benefit from having at least one type of reporting tool in place. This will help you keep your community a better and safe place for your members, encourages involvement from members in your moderation process, and allows for better understanding of the challenges your community is facing in terms of moderation.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Having a predefined method for users to contact the moderators will also improve the workflow, ensure better alignment of punishments and a fair process to punish those who violate your community rules.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Benefits and Challenges with Different Reporting Tools</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Different reporting options have varying benefits and challenges. You will need to find the right balance between the privacy of users, usability for members and moderators, as well as deciding whether or not you want conversation to be possible between your moderators and the reporters. The best option for your server will depend entirely upon your needs. Not all communities will benefit from having reporting channels and you might not want your moderators to handle issues in direct messages. Down below you will find a list of the most commonly used reporting options available, with their respective benefits and disadvantages.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Modmail Bots</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Modmail bots can be used for members of your community to report violations to the moderation team as a whole. There are several available options to choose from, all with their own unique viewpoint on support tickets. By using a Modmail bot, you will be able to have conversations with your reporters. Most other reporting tools do not allow you to have private conversations. Furthermore, Modmail bots allow for a lot of customization at the cost of being more time-consuming and difficult to set up. Additional benefits of using such a bot is being able to attach screenshots to a report and maintain privacy for both the mod handling the case and potentially even the user providing feedback, which some of the options do not offer. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Reporting Channels</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some servers utilize a specific channel dedicated to reporting violations of the rules. These can take different shapes depending on the use case. Different approaches include only allowing members to copy and paste message URLs to rule breaking messages or a more open discussion-based channel that provides a public-facing main source of reports. One thing is certain across all implementations of reporting channels: there should be a way to communicate with people that a report has been handled by either removing a message in the channel or reacting to it publicly. Reporting channels are very easy to set up as they use native Discord features. However, these channels can be limiting in functionality. Conversations are barely possible, depending on the permissions members might not be able to upload screenshots, and reports are not private which can deter some people from sharing concerns due to intimidation and fear of retaliation. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Reporting via Direct Messages</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Another option is to handle reports via direct messages. In this case, users simply send a message to any available moderator. This method allows for private reports, back-and-forth conversations with a member of the moderation team, and the ability to share screenshots. Using this method, players will have to rely on the availability of a single moderator, as they will be choosing who to report to. Furthermore, it is very hard to track moderator activity and if this is important to you, opting for this method should be avoided. Not all moderators will give a follow up to users and there is limited accountability.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Report Commands</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Some bots allow members to report others for breaking the rules. Reports often follow the format of tagging the person being reported and providing a reason. This information is then directed to the moderation team via a private channel. While the report is private, members still have to use a command (and ping the person they are reporting) in public channels. It also does not allow conversations to take place and uploading screenshots is not possible.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Pinging Moderator Roles</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Sometimes you simply want to allow members to ping a moderator role in case of public rule breaking behavior. This will most definitely immediately get the attention of your moderators and is most often the quickest reporting method to use. However, the user being reported will be notified as they can see the ping, and they might be able to remove their messages before a moderator can intervene. A way to help counteract this is to consider utilizing a moderation bot that logs message deletions or edits.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Logging and Flagging Messages</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While a lot of popular bots offer </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000178701\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">auto moderation</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> features that include word, spam, and advertisement filters, these can most often also be used to silently inform moderators. Instead of removing the message automatically and giving a punishment based on predefined rules, an option to create a flagging mechanism without automatic action can be utilized. If there’s a certain word or phrase used on a flag-list, the bot can notify moderators to look into it and decide the best course of action instead of automatically acting the way a blacklist would. This method allows your moderators to go through a channel with flagged messages and issue punishments based on the context of flagged messages and removes certain automatic moderation techniques that can lead to over-moderation.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Choosing What Works Best for You</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What method, or combination of methods, works best for you, depends a lot on your server size and needs. For smaller servers up to five thousand members being able to ping moderators in case of reports or having a report channel should be easily workable, depending on how big your team is. For large servers of fifty thousand members or more, you should look into using a Modmail bot. You might want a combination of multiple methods as well, depending on what works for you and the capabilities of your team.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Consider whether or not moderators should be able to communicate with the reporter about their report, not all methods offer this functionality. Ask yourself if the privacy of someone violating the rules is important to you, as not all methods are private reports. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you are using a levelling or experience system in the server, you might want to offer different reporting tools to members of a server level. For example, you might want to implement a command that can ping moderators, but only make that available to those of a certain level to prevent being pinged for minor moderation issues or by trolls abusing the pinging power. It is not advised to use a ping-based reporting method in larger servers due to how easily it can be abused.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Do you want to track the activity of your moderators? This is not possible for some methods. If your rules forbid advertisement via direct messages and moderators are to take action upon this being made aware of this violation, you should choose a reporting method that allows for screenshots to be shared.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Every community can benefit from having different reporting tools in place as this will help you keep your community a safe space for your members. Different reporting options have different benefits and challenges and you should take the time to analyze what option may best fit the needs of your community and moderation staff. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are six distinct reporting methods available via Discord’s native capabilities and bots:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Reporting via direct messages</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Utilization of a Modmail bot</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Creating a report channel with rules specific to your needs</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Using a report command that will ping reported members, but be shared privately with a moderation team</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Pinging a moderation team with an emergency team-wide ping</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Message flagging via automated mod</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Your server size will often dictate the best combination of the above options to find what reporting tools will work best for your team from a moderation standpoint, but you should also keep in mind the preferences of your community when it comes to reporting violations as your users also have to be comfortable when it comes to using your chosen report methods.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000177601\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">When hiring new moderators</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> for your community, it is important to acclimate them to the server culture and moderation team culture. Those without any prior experience will need guidance to grow their confidence in moderation. Training your moderators guarantees a baseline of knowledge that every moderator is supposed to know as well as provides structure for being able to inform your new moderators about the servers’ moderation standard, such as your guidelines, server culture, and recommended approaches.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Effective training covers not just  information about the moderation culture and general guidelines, but also about historical context to some rules or decisions that might be important to know for new moderators. For example, announcements that have been made in the past with information all moderators need to be aware of, but also information regarding banned topics and troublesome users. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After training your new moderators, they will have an easier time adjusting to the team and feel less pressured in actual moderation situations as they have previously had training. Training can help prevent moderators from making bad decisions, and lead to better alignment on the servers’ moderation philosophy.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Training Methods</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Each server has to decide for themselves what the most effective training method looks like. This article will present and explain some recommended methods that can simplify moderation training.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Buddy System</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The “Buddy System” approach describes working in pairs or groups, in which two or more “buddies” work together on one task. Requiring newer moderators to work with each other or even an assigned team member allows you to better monitor progress and for aid to come when required.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It promotes active communication and trust between moderators and also allows them to keep an objective view on everything. Having multiple opinions about certain matters and receiving assistance from a reliable source prevents moderators from feeling pressured with moderation tasks and can even open your eyes to new viewpoints. Additionally, it allows its members to effectively share their moderation skills with each other. It also aids in terms of personal safety: if a moderator feels personally attacked by a user, they get immediate support from their “buddies”</span> <span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">without feeling the need to tackle the issue alone.  </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Using this system allows less experienced moderators to quickly and effectively catch up to the moderation standards as they learn how to deal with specific matters first hand. It is important to remind the more experienced moderators on your team to allow new moderators to learn instead of wanting to quickly handle every task themselves. With time, certain actions will also become second nature for newer moderators, too!</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Mentoring System</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This approach is most commonly used when onboarding new moderators. Here experienced moderators or the head of staff introduce each new member of the team personally and guide them through the most important aspects. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The difference between this system and the “Buddy System” is that each new moderator will be acquainted with the moderation tasks and responsibilities by a higher up, and usually only once. After the walkthrough most recruits are expected to manage certain moderation duties on their own while being supervised. It is crucial to support and reassure them so they are able to grow confident in their actions. Recruits can display and appropriately train their soft skills and be informed about moderation standards in a controlled environment without fear or causing too much irreparable damage.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Regular Exercises</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Another method of efficiently training both experienced and inexperienced moderators is by letting them regularly test their knowledge. This involves designing exemplary situations of some everyday issues happening within your Discord server to let the trial moderators explain how they would handle them. Such instances can include how to handle issues in audio channels, user disputes, DM Discord invitations, off topic discussion in the incorrect channel, and potential issues that may be encountered with bots. At the end you should provide some sort of “model” or “example” answer to let the recruits know where they need to improve. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One negative effect of this system could be the fear of failure that some inexperienced moderators might be exposed to. Reassure them that making mistakes is okay as long as you take responsibility for your actions and are willing to learn from them. Moderation is an ever-shifting and learned art, and mistakes are not to be punished when they happen every once in a while. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It may be tempting to conduct these regular exercises incognito (aka acting up on an alt to see how they do) or test them without warning- while this may yield more “everyday” unbiased results, it has a high probability of backfiring. Blindsiding your moderation team with tests and exercises has the potential to do more harm than good, especially in terms of team trust and morale. It’s recommended that you don’t do this and instead, practice transparency when conducting regular exercises in order to avoid a potentially inequitable situation. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Presentations and Demonstrations</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Another form of training is to demonstrate how situations or scenarios are handled in your community via presentation or an actual demonstrative walk-through with moderation alt accounts. This is very useful for training where moderators have to use a wide range of commands, such as explaining moderation and Modmail bots. Ideally, this should take place in an audio channel or group call where you can share your screen. Not everyone is able or comfortable joining a voice chat and unmuting themselves, which is something to be considered beforehand.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Training Program Content</span></h3>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderator Documents</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An essential part of onboarding new moderators is to have an easily accessible </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000178021\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">document outlining the basic responsibilities</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and details on moderator tasks and different moderation teams. Such documents need to be designed for each server individually, but they usually contain general rules for staff, conduct expectations, and a punishment outline to set a standard and unity for moderation actions. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Recommended additions to such a moderation handbook are:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Elaborations on your rules to prevent users from finding loopholes in an attempt to “outplay” moderators. </span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405230544663\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">Explanations of certain Discord Terms of Service matters, such as copyright infringements, underaged users, implied racism and more.</a></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An overview of external rules to be applied within the server and a description of your moderation culture and expectations internally to help new moderators easily adjust to their new team.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Bot command overview to better be acquainted with commands instead of feeling pressured to remember them all immediately upon entry to a new team.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Commonly used “hacks” on Discord, such as phishing links, malicious files and other harmful softwares. </span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Be sure to recognize anything that is prevalent in your moderation culture or community that is also worth mentioning here! The more thorough the guidelines, the easier the document is to refer back to for any questions. For example, gaming servers should have a brief description of the featured gaming company’s Terms of Service and discussion about how to handle cheaters or users mentioning account sharing/selling in accordance with those rules. Another example would be for bot support servers where a brief description of commonly encountered issues and how to solve them as well as an FAQ section to help users with simpler answers.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderation Commands</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Another important topic new moderators should have easy access to are commands for moderation bots. Having a simple guide in a separate text channel with a quick guide of the bots’ prefix and format (command, user-id, [time], reason) will aid moderators in quickly responding to ongoing issues on the server. It lets them react fast without having to pause to look up the necessary command. Try to use the same prefix for the mainly used moderation bot to not cause unnecessary confusion, particularly for users who are new to moderating.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Modmail or Ticket Service</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Each server uses a differently designed service to assist moderators with helping out users. Bigger servers tend to rely on a ticket or Modmail system, so properly introducing them with sample conversations or problematic matters is essential for both the recruit and the future user. Confident moderators are more willing to aid users in need than those who are still unsure of how the system works. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This kind of training should include commonly used commands and procedures. There should be conversation about how to redirect users to higher staff and closing tickets appropriately so they don’t stack up and cause confusion. As long as a ticket system remains organization and those guidelines or organizations are established across the full team this will prove to be an easy to use communication system that is much less daunting than it may seem!</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Staff Safety</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">No user should ever feel unsafe or threatened on a Discord server. Staff members are often exposed to harmful or disrespectful messages, some of them targeted at some moderators directly. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An important aspect of onboarding moderators therefore is to make them aware of </span><a href=\\"http://dis.gd/dma202\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">how to react </span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">in such situations. They need to be able to create an environment in which it is comfortable for them to work in and not be afraid to ask for help if they feel threatened by users or, in extreme cases, other staff members. Staff members supporting each other and being able to communicate in such moments is crucial for an effectively working team.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Creating and Managing a Training Program</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Effective management promotes a feeling of professionalism and simplifies the process of training new moderators by a lot. Important aspects that should always be covered when creating a training program are time management, deciding on which staff are involved in training and why, effective communication, detailed content, and flexibility. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Choosing an appropriate approach.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> How do you want to introduce new members? What system did you conclude will work best for your server and staff team? Never be afraid to evolve an already existing plan into something that suits better for your current situation.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Deciding what topics to cover.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> What topics do you prioritize over others and think require more time investment than others? How are you moderators handling the learning process? Might there be anything in need of adjustment?</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Selecting voluntary participants. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Having a reliable team behind you to assist you in training is of most importance. Everyone involved should be aware of what exactly they need to teach and how to approach the training within a reasonable time frame. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Developing a timetable. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Find common ground between everyone involved, including both the mentors and trainees, and settle on when to teach what topic. Recommend tools to easily manage bigger teams are Google Docs and similar, but bots and self made timetables will suffice, too. Try to keep it simple and easily accessible for everyone involved. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Communication.</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Who responds to whom? Decide on how and when mentors report to the head of staff or other higher ups. Documenting helps with ensuring everyone is aware of their part and planning how to proceed further.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Flexibility. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">No matter how carefully you plan everything out, it can always happen that something doesn’t work according to plan. In such situations you need to be able to react spontaneously and be flexible, such as pitching in for someone who is unable to attend due to a last minute shift in schedule.</span></p>\\n<h1><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How to Deliver Effective Training</span></h1>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Before conducting training, you should evaluate what can make your training most effective. Below you will find some best practices to set up a training program and be able to “train the trainers”. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Planning</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When you are giving a training, it is important to properly plan your training. What are the most important topics to cover? What do you want new moderators to know after conducting the training? How much time are you planning to spend on training? Some people struggle to focus for a longer period of time, so if your training takes over two hours, you should consider breaking your training up into multiple sessions of shorter duration. Make sure to accommodate for any accessibility issues or notes for those who were unable to be present. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Goals</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Each training should have objectives. You can create an outline of your training where you write down the topics you will cover and the objective of that topic. For example, if you are training moderators to use Modmail, your objective is that new moderators are able to handle Modmail tickets and use the commands available to them. For each topic, also write down how you want to give this training: are you going to give a demonstration? Will you use illustrations? Will you offer new moderators to practice during your training and get hands-on experience? Publicly sharing this with trainees can help keep you on topic and allow them to come prepared with questions.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Practice</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After creating your training, make sure to practice it at least once. First, go through the entire training yourself to see if everything is covered that you think is important. You can then give your training to someone on your team, in case you missed something important and to check whether or not your estimated time is accurate. If it is possible, go through the material with someone who is unfamiliar with moderation. Adjust your training appropriately and you are good to go!</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Interaction</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For every training session, it is very important to have interaction with your trainees. People lose their attention after 15-30 minutes, so your training should include a discussion, practice, or some sort of interaction. Some of these interactive sessions are covered down below. Interaction with your trainees is also important because it acts as a way for you to verify whether or not your objectives are properly conveyed.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Make sure there is a break once every one to two hours so trainees can focus on your training without feeling overwhelmed.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Methods</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Every training can consist of a combination of different training methods. These include, but are not limited to, lectures, quick exercises, group discussions, practice runs, quizzes, videos, demonstrations, and more. When planning your training, you can write down what method would work best to convey the objectives to your trainees. A group discussion will be better applicable to discuss moderation cases, where a demonstration and practice would work better to demonstrate how Modmail bots work. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Try mixing up multiple methods within a training to keep it fresh and keep people from losing their attention.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Preparation</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Preparation is key when you are giving any sort of training. Have quick notes ready with keywords that you are going to use during your training, so you do not lose track of where you are and what objective you are trying to convey. If you need any material such as a presentation, paper and pencil, example cases and such, prepare them beforehand so you do not lose time during your training setting these up. If you use any material, test them beforehand.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Don’t forget to clear your schedule beforehand and have some water ready if your training is mostly conducted over a voice chat or call. It is important to sleep well the night before and feel confident. This will let you remain focused and have an uninterrupted training session.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Make sure you are ready at least five minutes before the training starts to welcome arriving trainees and as a final check whether or not everything is ready and good to go. If your training takes place in a voice chat or call, test your microphone and if you have a wireless headset, make sure it is charged up beforehand! </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Wrapping up your training</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When your training is done, finish with an exercise, group discussion, or something else that is interactive and fun to do. Ideally, this should summarize the entire training. Have some room at the end to answer any questions your trainees might have. Don’t forget to thank everyone who participated for their active contributions! </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Evaluation</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After each training, write down what went well and what could be improved. You can ask your trainees after they have had some experience as a moderator, what they missed during training that they think should be covered next time, as well as asking what information they did not find useful. You can then adjust your training for next time!</span></p>\\n<h1><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Summary</span></h1>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Having a training or onboarding process in place is very important to have new moderators get accustomed with moderation culture, using bot commands, the server rules, and your moderation guidelines. There are several training methods that include buddy or mentor systems as well as exercises and demonstrations. A training document should outline the most important information new moderators need, but prevent them from being overwhelmed with information they are unable to comprehend. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To have efficient training in place, there are some very important aspects to consider, such as your preparation, goals, how you will carry out the training of your new moderators, and planning. Considering all of these things when creating your training process will make onboarding as informational and effective as possible for you and your new recruits!</span></p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The backbone of Discord can be found in its infinite communities. Communities are created by people (like you!) and bring people together over their shared interests, a pursuit of knowledge, or even those simply searching for a space to hang out. On Discord, there are communities for just about everything -- if there’s a group of people that care about something, there’s probably a place where people talk about it on Discord and find new friends.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Before we dive in too deep, though, let’s start at the top. What is a community?</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Defining a Community</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A community on Discord is an </span><strong>environment </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">(usually in the form of a Discord server, but it can be larger, like a network of affiliated servers) where a group of people come together over a shared </span><strong>interest or passion</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. This shared interest is the inspiration behind your community and it could be anything: a game, a content creator, a movie, a book series, or even something more niche like a fan club for a secondary character from a beloved TV show. You can build a community around anything, really, and find people all over the world who want to talk about that passion with you. And maybe sometimes similar communities already exist, but that doesn’t mean you can’t build your own space. More communities mean more space to experiment, learn, and grow.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once you’ve identified the interest or a passion you want your server to focus on, the next step in defining your community is to identify its </span><strong>purpose</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. Imagine a community centered around an author — people might want to join to talk about the author, or participate in a read along, find similar authors, talk about future books, or more. Maybe all of this belongs in one community, but maybe there can be multiple communities each focused on a specific case.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For your community, you’ll want to determine what people will get out of it and how it will appeal to current and future members. Members may come to a community seeking information, camaraderie, or support (or all of the above!), and it’s important to understand what you and your members want your community to be.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To help institute a purpose, remember to think about your community from the perspective of a new member. Ask yourself some questions. What is this community for? What’s the coolest part about it? Why do I want to stick around? Identifying your community’s purpose as clearly as possible will help you to answer these questions and make your community interesting and distinct.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now that you’ve identified an interest and a purpose, share this with the members of your community! You should share your server guidelines and expectations publicly, usually in a welcome channel and in a server ruleset that users are expected to abide by. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">One last note — remember that the purpose of your community may shift as your user base ages and grows. Be flexible and grow with your community’s needs to successfully foster a healthy environment. Revisiting your founding mission and adapting it as necessary will allow your community to thrive as it goes from a hundred to a thousand to, maybe, a million people.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">How do I keep my community safe?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">After defining your community’s purpose, the next most important element of running an online community is </span><strong>moderation</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There’s more to moderating a community than just understanding how to use Discord’s moderation tools. Think of it this way- building a community is like building a city, and moderators are responsible for several facets of constructing that space including:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Building Infrastructure. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Building the foundations and the roads and bridges of a community. Creating new roles, channels, and updating rules as necessary to maintain a healthy environment. This may also include moderation bot wrangling and programming.</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>User Safety. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Keeping the peace and removing immediate threats. Enforcing your community’s punishment scale to ensure all your users are safe.

It’s true what they say--teamwork really does make the dream work. Establishing a healthy, professional, and respected moderation team is essential to creating a space that users feel safe in. Not only does a moderation team distribute workload, but it allows for new ideas and perspectives — maybe you’re not as technical, and bringing in a bot expert allows for automating some manual chores. Or maybe you could use an events expert to really get people to know each other on a more regular basis! Managing different philosophies is integral to understanding the many interests that may emerge in your growing community over time, and having a good moderation team means that it’ll better reflect in your server as a whole.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What’s Next?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now that you know what a community is and the expectations that come with being a moderator, it is time for you to begin your journey.

The following article exists under the assumption that you have a server already in existence, regardless of whether or not it is in actual usage yet.<br><br></span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What, Exactly, is Patreon?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Let’s start with the obvious question: what is Patreon? In case you are unfamiliar with Patreon, it is a subscription service for content creators similar to YouTube Memberships and Twitch Subscriptions. Supporters ( hereby referred to as “patrons”) can pay a monthly fee to access content from creators they are supporting. This private content can cover a wide range of content including text posts, polls, videos, images, merchandise, and more. The possibilities are truly endless and you, as a content creator, have control over how much value you place on the content you produce and distribute over Patreon.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Patreon also uses tiered platforms based upon monetary commitment. For example, let’s say you are a comic book creator that can generate an entire comic in a month’s time. You could charge patrons $5 to access works in progress, maybe snippets of the story you’re writing, or behind the scenes streams of you working on an anticipated page or panel. At the next $10 tier, patrons can gain access to the whole comic as a reward, and maybe even access polls to help you decide what to do next. Further, a $25 reward could be that patrons have complete access to your entire library, or get a physical edition of your comic book sent to them! The ideas are endless when it comes to what kind of rewards you can offer your patrons. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In fact, one of the new ways to explore rewards systems for patrons is via Discord.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Why Create Discord Rewards?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">For content creators that use platforms like Patreon, providing rewards to patrons is an absolute necessity because it directly benefits those who choose to support you. One of the simpler rewards creators can provide patrons is a Discord reward system automatically managed by the Patreon Bot. An example of such an award allows you to assign one or more roles to patrons in your Discord server based upon their subscription tier on Patreon. Once they have their designated roles, you can utilize channel permissions to provide your supporters with exclusive access to aspects of your server like hidden channels or perhaps even hoist them in the sidebar of your Discord server as an added bonus. This gives them closer access to you as a creator as well as your content and your community. This, in turn, can make them feel appreciated as support and perhaps allow them to see a direct impact of their support on your content.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Installing a Discord Rewards System on Patreon</span></h3>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The first step to setting up Discord Rewards on Patreon is to have a Patreon account. Once you’ve started building your Patreon page (or have one completed), you’ll need to head into your “Tiers” section of your page.<br><br></span></p>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4414901211927/1.png\\" alt=\\"1.png\\"></span></p>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\\"> </p>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once in the “Tiers” section, pick the tier you’d like to grant the access to your rewards in your Discord server. We recommend that this </span><strong>should</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> be the </span><strong>lowest</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> tier you’d allow patrons to subscribe at in order to receive a special role in a Discord server that we are presuming is public. Once you’ve selected your chosen tier, you’ll need to connect your Patreon to Discord.<br><br><br><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4414908660887/2.png\\" alt=\\"2.png\\"><br></span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now, let’s make this reward a reality with the following steps:</span></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Select the “Advanced” option within the “Benefits” section.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Click that great, big, blurple button to connect to Discord.</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Allow the pop-up window to authenticate with Discord.

Make sure you have the </span></em><strong><em>Manage Server</em></strong><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> permission in order to see it. If you don’t, double check with the server owner and have them add it to one of your roles in order to successfully connect to Patreon.</span></em></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Customizing Your Discord Rewards</span></h3>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Roles, Roles, and more Roles</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">With your Patreon page successfully linked with your Discord server, you may notice this message in Patreon:<br><br></span></p>\\n<p><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4414901213847/4.png\\" alt=\\"4.png\\"><br><br></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To finalize reward set-up, you need to </span><a href=\\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">create the actual roles</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. We recommend creating a different role for each of the Patreon tiers you have and distinguishing the roles by naming them after the tiers’ name or the amount of money pledged by patrons of each tier. For example, if you have a $50 per month Patreon tier named Top Contributor, you could name the corresponding reward role either “$50” or “Top Contributor.” This usually works out the most suitably for future rewards, because you can easily distinguish your followers who send $5 a month, versus those sending $50 a month, and change role permissions accordingly if you are offering them different levels of Discord access.<br><br><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4414908661527/5.png\\" alt=\\"5.png\\"><br></span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Remember that it is important to keep the Patreon Bot’s role above all the other roles we make for this purpose so it can help manage them.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now that your tier roles are in the server, there should be no more red warning text on the Patreon Tier Creation page. If there is, give it a quick refresh. The disappearance of this text means that you can now check the box “Gives patrons access to selected Discord roles.” If you are using multiple roles for each tier of your Patreon for organization in your server, make sure they’re all added. After setting your channels and permissions spoken about in the next step, double check that the correct role in your Discord server is associated with the proper tier on your Patreon page.<br><br><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4414901214615/6.png\\" alt=\\"6.png\\"><br></span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Success!

Now lets establish accessibility levels.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Channels and Permissions</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">At this point, you’ll want to build a structure to your server for these new tier roles. Head back to the channel list and decide how you’d like to reward your different tiers. Do you want each tier to have their own channel category, or do you want one channel category with different channels designated to different tiers? Make sure to give each category and/or channel permissions associated with each role that you want to have access to that area.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">We have an example based upon the channel list image below to see some of our recommendations in action. This example utilizes one channel category for all patrons, but gives certain patron tiers different levels of access.   <br></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4414908662295/7.png\\" alt=\\"7.png\\">          <img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4414908662807/8.png\\" alt=\\"8.png\\"></span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You’ll notice Patreon allows you to assign users multiple roles when they subscribe to a tier. This makes it handy to ensure your private channels and categories are easier to manage across the different role tiers. In our provided example you’ll see that all patrons have access to an exclusive general text and voice channel to talk to each other regardless of tiers. However, different tier levels are given access to different additional perks such as sharing social media links for the creator to follow back, polls for future content, and a VIP text and voice chat to better talk to the creator they’re supporting.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Congratulations on launching your new and/or updated Patreon page! The beauty of this system is that you can continue to create new roles and channel permissions to best serve your community as you continue to grow. Now that you’re done with the basic steps outlined in this guide, all you have to do is edit/add/drop/shift roles around as needed to ensure you are making the most of your Discord Rewards patron program.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Patreon rewards give your fans and supporters exclusives in exchange for supporting your work. Having this automated system to handle and manage your supporters means you can spend more time making new content, and less time worrying about a bot, or a function in Discord whenever new patrons sign up. It also makes managing permissions much more simpler because you have a lot more control over which roles a patron is assigned to based on their subscription tier.</span></p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Voice channels are a great way for your server members to engage with each other and can be utilized in many different ways. You might have a system for users to find other users to play games with or maybe you just have some general chat channels to hang out and listen to music. Regardless of the types of voice channels you have, you\'re going to need to moderate these voice channels, which can reveal some interesting challenges. In this article, we\'ll identify these challenges and go over some things that can help you to overcome them.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Why Moderate Voice Channels?</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Before we talk about how to moderate voice channels, it\'s important to consider why it\'s necessary. In some servers voice channels are rarely used, or only used for events where a moderator is present. If this is the case for your server, moderating voice channels is likely much more straightforward. This article will focus on how to moderate voice channels in servers where voice channels are used frequently and without moderators present. However, the information in this article is still useful to any server with voice channels. Although these situations may be rarer for your server, it doesn\'t hurt to be prepared if they do indeed occur.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What to Look Out For</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Many of the moderation issues you will encounter while moderating voice channels will be the spoken equivalent of situations you would encounter in text channels. However, you can\'t keep records of what is said in voice channels without recording everything with a bot, which is not easy to do, nor is it something your server members will likely be comfortable with. This means that if no moderator is present in the voice channel at the time of a user being troublesome, you will likely hear about the situation from a user who was present for it. We will discuss best practices in handling these user reports in the next section of this article. There are also a few situations specific to voice channels to be aware of. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Common situations that would require moderator intervention that might occur in voice channels are as follows:</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A user is being rude or disrespectful to a specific user</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A user is saying discriminatory phrases or slurs in a voice channel</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A user is playing audio or video of Not Safe For Work content</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A user is rapidly joining and leaving a voice channel or multiple voice channels (voice hopping)</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A user is producing audio shock content (loud noises intended to startle or harm a listeners’ ears)</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Risk Management for Voice Channels</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Before we even consider how we plan to moderate situations that may arise in voice channels, let\'s discuss ways to prevent them from happening in the first place, or at least make it easier for us to deal with them later. One of the easiest and most useful things you can do is set up voice channel logging. Specifically, you can log when a user joins, leaves or moves between voice channels. Many moderation bots support this type of logging. You can read more about using bots for moderation in </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000178701\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">DMA article 321</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. For reference, here\'s what this kind of voice channel logging might look like:</span></p>\\n<p><br><br></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Having voice logs will allow you to catch voice hoppers without having to be present in a voice channel. It will also prove useful in verifying reports from server members and ensuring users can\'t make a false report about other users who weren\'t actually present in a voice channel at the time. Another thing you can do to prevent trolls from infiltrating voice channels (and every other part of your server) is having a good verification gate. You can read more about verification gates </span><a href=\\"https://discord.com/moderation/1500000177981-301:-Implementing-Verification-Gates\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">here</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Handling Reports from Your Server Members</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Now that we know what to look for when moderating voice channels and how to take some preventative measures, it\'s time to address the elephant in the room. What do we do when a member of the server reports rule breaking behavior in a voice channel, but no moderator was there to witness it? If we believe them and treat their word as fact, we can take care of the situation accordingly. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While this may work for certain situations, there is the possibility that troublesome users may realize that the moderators are acting on all reports in good faith and begin to try to take advantage of this policy and create false reports. This is obviously very problematic, so let\'s now consider the opposite scenario. If a moderation team doesn\'t believe any of the reports and moderate situations only when a moderator is present, it\'s likely that the troublesome user can keep getting away with their rule breaking behavior. In some cases, even if a moderator is available to join a voice channel when they receive a report, they might find that the troublesome user stops their behavior when the moderator joins, thus making it impossible to verify the report. This can be partially mitigated by moderators using alternate accounts to join the voice channel and appear as a user, but ultimately there will be situations where mods aren\'t available and reports will need to be considered.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In general, any singular report should not be believed based on the report alone. When a user reports a situation in a voice channel, the following questions should be asked:</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\"><strong>Has the user made reports in the past? Were they legitimate?</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Active users who make many legitimate reports can likely be trusted. The more legitimate reports a user has made, the more likely it is that they can be trusted. Even if a trusted user makes a false report at some point, it is often easy to undo any false actions taken.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\"><strong>How long has the user been a part of the server and how much have they contributed?</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Positive contributions in your server (such as quality conversations or being welcoming and supportive of other server members) is also a way that members might gain trust. This trust is something that can be handled the same way you handle trust gained from legitimate reports.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\"><strong>Did multiple users report the situation or can others who were present confirm the report? If so, do these users have any sort of connection to each other? Could they be the same person on multiple accounts?</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If multiple users report the same issue, and you know they are not connected, the report can safely be trusted  as long as the information in the reports are consistent with each other. Knowing when users are connected can be difficult in some cases, but some signs you can look for are: users who joined the server at the same time, users with IDs close to each other (signifying similar account creation times), similar behavior or patterns of talking, or interactions with each other which signify the users know each other from somewhere else. It is important to ensure that this isn’t an organized effort from a group of friends or alternate accounts targeting another user.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li aria-level=\\"1\\"><strong>Does the report seem plausible? Is the person being reported someone you expect would cause trouble?</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are many things you can look at when examining the user being reported. Some things to look out for are offensive or inappropriate usernames, profile pictures, or statuses, and any inappropriate messages sent by the user in the past. Inappropriate messaging can be anything from spam to rude or offensive behavior or even odd or confusing behavior.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If the answers to these questions leads to more skepticism and questioning of the legitimacy of the report, then it may be the case that the report can\'t be trusted. If you are not confident in the report\'s legitimacy, </span><strong>you should still make a note of the report</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, in case similar reports are made in the future. Repeated reports are one of the most common ways to discover that a report is likely legitimate and allow you to make a better informed decision later on. It may also be the case that the answer to these questions reveals that the report is likely illegitimate, in which case you may punish the reporter(s) accordingly. Intentional false reporting is a breach of trust with a moderation team, but reports made in good faith that are unactionable should not result in punishment.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Handling Severe Situations</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Occasionally, you might find yourself faced with a difficult, time sensitive situation where someone is at risk of being harmed, or harming themselves. Because nothing is recorded in voice channels, it is not possible to report these types of situations to Discord. If you witness situations such as these, or if you receive reports of them, you should reach out to those involved in DMs or a text channel in the server. You can also attempt to dissolve the situation in the voice channel if you are confident in your abilities to do so, but it may be harder to get the authorities involved if it is necessary if there is no evidence of the situation in a DM or text channel. Once you have done that, follow the steps in </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058643194\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">DMA article 104</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> to report the user(s) to Discord. Whether or not you are able to move the situation to a DM or text channel, </span><strong>call your local authorities if you believe someone is in imminent danger. </strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you know the area where the person in danger lives, you may also want to call the authorities in their area.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Handling situations in voice channels can be difficult, but with the right tools and protocols in place, your servers’ moderation team can be prepared for anything. After reading this article, you should have a good understanding of when voice moderation is needed, and how to properly enact voice moderation scenarios. This article outlined some of the most common situations that you should look out for, as well as how to prepare for some situations proactively. It also showed how you can handle user reports in a way that minimizes the possibility of actioning false reports. Finally, you learned how to handle severe, time-sensitive situations, where someones’ life may be in danger.

As a school server, your goals will not often align with community servers driven by users seeking like minded people with similar interests.

Generally, educational environments follow a pre-existing set of ideals when considering the principles revolving around when and how to teach students. Although new and unknown software may be daunting, this article aims to prove how useful Discord can be in an educational environment while also examining the drawbacks. Discord creates a new schooling environment as it is a constant online platform where students, teachers, and staff members can communicate, do schoolwork, engage in lessons, and even have some fun. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Benefits of Using Discord in Classrooms</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Lots of new opportunities are created for schools who make use of a private Discord server. One of the biggest opportunities is presented in a cultural shift away from formality and closer to general bonding. Gone are the days of formal communications over e-mail and instead we have open chat discussions with teachers, fellow classmates, group project members, and even private one-on-one’s (similar to office hours!) when necessary.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In this section we seek to discuss the many ways that Discord can help virtual learning. Discord can function as a virtual classroom setting in ways that can generate new opportunities for continued and reliable teamwork while enabling new and exciting ways for students to connect with each other.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Utilizing Discord as a Virtual Classroom</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While certain </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000176222\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">permissions</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> are essential to creating an environment that separates teachers and student private chats and subjects, a classroom environment acts as the overall hub for everything necessary from a full school, to a specific classroom, to separate groups working on projects, and even a variation of subjects being taught. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Simultaneously, a server can be set up to serve a variety of school-related functions including, but not limited to:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A Q&amp;A forum for questions about a shared lesson where students can help each other, but teachers can also jump in to assist</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Private student-teacher meeting spaces for additional tutoring or conversations regarding behavior</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Voice channels where students can talk or video call to build out projects in designated groups</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Break-out channels accessible only by assigned groups for group work that teachers can monitor to ensure equal participation</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The utilization of screen-sharing to have a live online class in a voice channel for up to fifty students</span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord’s Real Time Communication Abilities</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord naturally lends itself to communication in ways that allow students to help each other. If one student is stuck on an assignment, any student can answer their question or perhaps join them in a study session to work out the problem together. Schoolwork can feel less solitary, there is less of a reliance on teachers and aids, and students who may be taking the same subject in different classes can meet each other and help each other out. This also allows teachers to monitor such a space to gain insight as to where their students are struggling so they can adjust their lesson plans accordingly. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Interaction with each other doesn’t have to be limited to just typing in designated channels. Students can interact with each other and teachers while using subject specific audio and/or video channels as well, allowing them to have more personal interactions and cater to different learning styles. However, if you are using these channels to broadcast a lesson and not promote group work, make sure that you disable voice activity for students to avoid accidental noise from being broadcasted throughout your online classroom. This helps create a controlled environment for all involved in the virtual classroom space. An example about how to do this is below.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Teamwork Makes the Dream Work</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Teamwork is a necessary skill in educational settings and Discord’s platform is especially adept at helping to facilitate this. Students can use Group DMs to create private areas to communicate among group members to communicate about a project outside of designated school hours. If you’d like to oversee a groups’ efforts to make sure that everyone is contributing equally, you can also create private chat and audio channels in your school’s Discord server that are accessible only by teachers and students in a designated group project. In a remote teaching setting this allows the teacher to monitor multiple teams at once while being easily accessible to assist or help with any questions, reviewing, or general coaching that is needed for the assignment.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">With the proper channel permissions, Discord can also allow several students to </span><a href=\\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045784891-Video-Screenshare-Updates-Multistream-and-More-\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">share multiple screens at once</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. This is ideal for multitasking and group work so that students can be assisting each other in group work in real-time without having to leave the comfort of their own homes.<br><br></span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord’s Easy to Use Interface Will Make Students Feel at Home</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord was created for housing online communities which sets it apart from other routes taken for e-learning platforms. Your students and staff will feel at home in the Discord user interface because it is easy to use and made for quick adaptation. The natural familiarity that many students may bring from their personal usage of the platform and even other similar platforms will reduce the friction of adopting into new virtual learning atmospheres and more easily help transition Discord into their daily educational routines.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A common complaint in larger classroom settings, both in person and virtually, is that the environment is impersonal. In a sea of many faces, it is understandable that a student may feel like just another number on the attendance roster. However, Discord’s premise of providing an easily built space meant for easy and informal communication can reduce this lack of personal connection and instead help students feel welcome, including, and easily engaged.<br><br></span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There is Always Fun to be Had in a Healthy Community</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When creating your virtual classroom it is important to keep in mind what you want the purpose of your server to be. A server for a specific math classroom taught by Mr. Wumpus at noon everyday is going to be geared entirely towards education, whereas a more open-concept Algebra server that welcomes all students currently enrolled in the course under various teachers to have a more common meeting space while also being split into their respective virtual classrooms via permissions allows for antics in addition to education. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Educational settings can also be fun if you choose to build them that way. There is always fun to be had in a healthy community when the school day finishes, and providing this hang out space for students will allow them to not only bond but associate positive feelings with school. There can be spaces designated to help students study together in after school hours or perhaps come together to take a study break to play one of their favorite games. A music bot can be used to listen to music in an essay-writing sprint, and a leveling system can be used to reward students for participation. Community feelings lead to happiness, which can impact mental health and grading.<br><br></span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord is an Extension of your Physical Campus</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord also brings many advantages to educational arenas outside of the classroom. A server can be viewed as an extension of your physical campus to the Internet in an e-learning environment. Similar to a real-life campus, Discord is a meeting place for students and staff to chat, get to know each other, and build a stronger community in places they feel safe. Shy students may even find it easier to bond better in an online environment than a physical one which can lead to generating new friendships while also improving pre-existing ones. Students who perceive a welcoming environment and have positive feelings about their school and community will often get better grades because of higher motivations levels.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Interestingly, a further extension of a physical campus would be to an alumni association. While school related Discord servers are often for study tools or virtual classrooms, they can also serve as special places for alumni to connect after graduation. They can not only catch up with their old classmates, but they can mentor current students as well. Such a situation can be brought about via unique ideas like career fairs oriented towards advising current students about future career options by making use of a schools’ alumni network.</span></p>\\n<h3>The Disadvantages of Using Discord as a School Platform</h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As mentioned above, Discord’s widespread usage for personal gaming and easy to use interface means that a lot of students could already use Discord in their free time or begin to adopt it into their lives after being introduced to it in a classroom setting. The person someone may present themselves as online can differ from who they are in real life. When given the opportunity to use a profile picture, set usernames and nicknames, and even statuses, things can get out of hand quickly. It may even be difficult for some teachers to identify which student is behind certain accounts if these expectations aren’t established immediately upon server creation.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">With the likely change that a student might not want to use a picture of themself as their profile picture, it is important to establish server guidelines about what is appropriate to be in that photo. While some users may not be comfortable using their full name or even their first name in their username, set the expectation that everyone has to change their nickname in your private school-related Discord servers to their real name. When students first enter the server, we recommend enabling </span><a href=\\"https://discord.com/moderation/1500000176222-201:-Permissions-on-Discord\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Developer Mode</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> to privately connect each individual User ID to a student should someone mess up their identity in the future.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is also imperative to reiterate the boundary that you expect everything present in the virtual school ecosystem to be school appropriate. Features like profile pictures, username, and status are platform-wide features that appear in all servers a user is in. What is appropriate in some spaces may not be appropriate in school. Consider this ahead of time to establish rules around this and also punishments should this not be respected. It is important to keep in mind that Discord does have strict Terms of Service and Community Guidelines that state users aren’t allowed to use NSFW content and other forms of illegal content as their username, profile picture, and/or status. This will partly make sure the content on their profiles is acceptable to a degree. However, you may not be comfortable if a student is cursing in your virtual classroom and that can be dealt with accordingly by you.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Discord’s very purpose is to foster communication by bringing users an easy to understand interface that is adaptable to a variety of needs, thus making it a really useful modern tool for e-learning and virtual classrooms. With the right permissions, students can be brought into environments where they can not only learn, but also have fun in a virtual extension of their physical campus. Through utilization of a variety of ways to teach classrooms and communicate amongst groups, Discord naturally fosters teamwork and open forum discussions between students and teachers alike.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">However, Discord is still a platform with millions of users exploring a variety of interests. It’s important to enter Discord prepared to handle students who may be using inappropriate media for school via platform-wide features like profile pictures, statues, and usernames because they are appropriate elsewhere. If you consider the logistics of creating a safe, school-appropriate environment and set expectations and guidelines upon entry, Discord is a great tool for your future educational needs!</span></p>"')

While the average user may not be aware of the thought processes behind instituting server role colors, it is important to recognize role colors as a potentially important tool in your server depending upon how you choose to use them. Whether your role colors are for an aesthetic or to distinguish certain users, careful consideration needs to be put into the color scheme of your servers’ roles.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Types of Color Role Systems</span></h3>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderator Colors</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Giving moderators a uniquely colored role can help them stand out in chat so that users are aware of when they are receiving an official verbal warning or direction. This can be very helpful in any server, but some structures that this system are most helpful in may include:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Large, busy servers where individual messages do not really stand out in a faster moving chat</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Family friend spaces or servers targeted at younger users who may not oblige with requests from moderation and instead try to argue</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Smaller servers with a more horizontal leadership structure where it is likely that members will be self-moderating to a degree</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000179901\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">Reddit servers</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> where you are trying to differentiate between Reddit moderation teams and Discord moderation teams</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The words and actions of moderators hold more weight and urgency when geared towards problematic behavior and a colored role differentiation in addition to a hoisted position on the sidebar draws attention to their existence.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Having a separate color for moderators can also lead to some unfortunate social effects since moderators are not always moderating, but their unique role coloration exists to make them stand out in the server. This means if they’re just trying to converse with fellow users, eyes are more quickly drawn to their color for when they need to dispense advice. In heavily active servers, users may be more likely to see most of what a moderator posts since their messages stand out from everything else, but a moderator is unlikely to see most of what any individual user posts; this can lead to a </span><a href=\\"http://dis.gd/dma531\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">parasocial relationship</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> where users think that they know or are friends with the servers moderators. It can also lead to users paying undue attention to moderators when they are just around to chat, potentially ignoring other users, or drawing attention to the fact that a moderator has entered chat, effectively killing prior conversation topics. In certain servers, this can also be cause for concern if it is attracting the wrong kind of people to moderation based positions who are seeking hoisted roles or incorrect perceived perks of moderation positions. Overall, having a color for moderators is important in communities that are seeking to differentiate who is and isn’t a moderator in chat, but it can also lead to certain situations that may degrade a moderator’s ability to use the server normally as a member. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When utilizing such a role, It is important to keep an eye out for responses that do not treat moderators as respected members of the server and respond appropriately. Moderators are members first, and should be able to use the server in much the same way they did before becoming moderators, in addition to carrying out their moderation related duties. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Expert/Support Colors</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you are running any sort of support server, whether for a bot, a coding language, a game, or some other external service, it may be important to differentiate between regular users and developers or trusted experts. It will be a lot easier to tell if you are getting credible advice if there is a colored role that indicates that users with this color know what they are talking about. This type of system is useful for proficient users and developers. Such role usage can help prevent issues where misguided or confused users mistake a developer\'s explanation of their own code for incorrect advice.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">An important thing to note about this system is that there are some pitfalls. It can inadvertently lead to a distrust of other users who do not have the proficient helper/developer support role color because they know they can get correct advice from a different source. They might dismiss others trying to help them with the knowledge that they can eventually get a developer’s attention, which can lead to a sense of entitlement to that direct advice. Of course, this can happen without role colors, but the addition of role colors make developer interaction more obvious and place them on a support pedestal that is often desired by those seeking advice.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Patreon/Booster Colors</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Giving </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405267400855\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">patrons</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, server boosters, or any other sort of member who has made financial contributions to the server a separate color from the rest of the server can be a good way to incentivize or reward the people who are helping keep your server, bot, service, or giveaways afloat. However, it can also contribute to a sense of elitism within the server. This inadvertent hierarchy can be misinterpreted as users being entitled to special treatment above the rules in exchange for their financial support of the server. Thankfully, both of these negative viewpoints are relatively easy to identify and combat, especially if you define what each of these kinds of roles get you clearly in your server rules so there is less assumption and personal interpretation of nonexistent hierarchical perks.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Level/Server Currency Colors</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If your server has some sort of activity based </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058645954\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">leveling system</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">, or a server currency system, it may be fun to include colored roles as rewards or shop items that can be purchased with the server currency. These systems can help you reward your most active members, and if your server currency has an attendance incentive it can even be used for event participation. It is important to note that these systems are abusable, and can contribute to low-effort contributions that are effectively just spamming for levels or points, or in extreme cases, even self-botting (automating actions on a non-bot, regular user account) and other forms of cheating. They can also contribute to toxic competitive environments and chats that can be unpleasant for users who do not care about the server levels or currency to try to break into. If utilizing such a system, it is important to think of ways to combat spam before implementation. Additionally, remember that self-bots are against Discord’s Terms of Service and should be reported and dealt with accordingly upon discovery.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Ideally, you want a level or server currency system to be something that is a fun background mechanic in the server, but not people\'s main reason for participating. These issues are not unique to colored roles, but anything that makes these systems more prominent and visible in chat will draw more attention to them. Level roles in particular can also contribute to the previously discussed accidental hierarchy built within the community by clearly establishing active long-term users from newer users. Climbing a level ladder can be intimidating, after all. </span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Informational Colors</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Color roles can be used to signal information depending upon the type of community you run. Some examples include pronoun roles, what games a user plays, the age range they fit into, where they are from, and any other information your community may deem relevant for your users to know. This type of system is beneficial for sharing and collecting info about others. However, users may choose roles that they do not actually align with because they want the chat color associated with it, which is a detriment to more elaborate informational color systems. If you decide to utilize an informational color system it’s important to remember that Discord only shows the color that is highest on the role list and roles should be ordered with this in mind.</span></p>\\n<h4><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Seasonal/Self-Assignable Colors</span></h4>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The final type of role color discussed in this article is those decided by the server staff for aesthetic, but have no perks attached to them. Seasonally themed roles require a bit more work on the part of whoever is in charge of selecting the colors and naming the color roles, but can be a fun way to mark the passage of time, important events like winter holidays, or just change things up in the appearance of the server every once in a while with minimal effort. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Self-assignable colors have no downside other than increasing the number of roles your server has. They are a way to let users have a bit more control over their profile and how they appear to others, and change things up when they want to. Self-assignable colors are a fun and inclusive way to engage users, especially when part of a serverwide aesthetic.  </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Accessibility</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When choosing role colors, you should keep accessibility in mind. A role color the same as the Discord background may seem like an entertaining color choice, but it can prove to be unreadable to many, for example. It is most important to remember that role colors need to be legible across all Discord themes including dark, light, and AMOLED themes. Many users may also have a form of color blindness, which should be considered when generating a color theme that is accessible for everyone.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is important to ensure that role colors have sufficient contrast against the variety of background colors that Discord provides. There are many tools out there that can help you compare role colors, mimic the effects of various forms of color blindness, and see how much contrast they have so that you can see whether role colors will appear too similar or be difficult to read for some users. </span><a href=\\"https://dragory.github.io/role-preview-for-discord/\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The Dragory Discord Preview Tool</span></a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> is specifically made for Discord and can easily be used to visualize everything you need to make sure you are choosing appropriate role colors all in one place. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderation colors should easily stand-out amongst server users to draw attention to them. If your server mostly uses cool colors, make them something warm. If you’re dominated by pastels, go for something with more saturation. Make it so that eyes are drawn to them if you use this system. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusion</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This article reviewed the many possible role color systems that you can utilize in your server by walking you through the benefits and drawbacks of each. These systems can also all be combined with each other in order to create a system that you believe serves your community best through experimentation. Luckily, the stakes for changing role color systems are pretty low. While role colors can have an impact on the way people interact with your server and with certain members, it will not make or break your server to try out a new seasonal theme and/or return to a previous theme if it is necessary. As long as you understand the risks associated with each kind of setup, keep an eye out for unwanted responses to your color scheme, and remember to utilize accessible colors, you can use whatever kind of system you want. There is no wrong answer here--just have fun with finding your server aesthetic! </span></p>"')

There are outlying factors that affect the rate of new joins for all servers including holidays, breaks in school, and times of year when Discord picks up new users at a higher rate--such as the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are also times where specific communities will see a rapid increase in new joins. This can look different for different types of servers. For verified servers, this could be immediately following the content creator or game developer that the server is based around plugging the server on Twitter, hosting an AMA, or hosting events or tournaments within the server; for LGBTQ+ servers, this could be during and preceding Pride Month; and for gaming servers this can come from new updates being pushed or leaks being revealed. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In addition, any servers that are on Discord’s Server Discovery will potentially see a huge increase in their join rates depending on their focus and the keywords they have in Discovery, especially if they are featured on the front page by Discord. Popup event servers that are being set up temporarily or servers that are mentioned by people with large followings will also see a huge influx of users joining very rapidly from whatever avenues the server was advertised through.  </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Growth can be difficult to manage at normal rates, and explosive growth can be especially difficult. Teams will need to prepare for influxes of users, manage their entry into the space, ensure that they can integrate with and navigate the different parts of the community during a more turbulent or hectic time, and maintain the purpose and mission of the community with minimal disruption. Throughout all of this, moderators will also have to deal with an increase in the volume of bad actors joining and the increase in required moderation actions to keep things running smoothly.  </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This document will serve to educate you on how best to handle and prepare for a significant increase in your server growth over a short period of time, whether it be for a temporary event space or for an existing server that’s getting a boost. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Internal Coordination</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You should check in with your moderation team before large events to ensure they are still on board and understand that they will be experiencing an increased demand for their time and attention. Avoiding burnout should be one of your main goals in evaluating your staffing; if you are already short staffed or your staff members are juggling just as much as they can handle, you need to be aware before you are dealing with thousands of new users. You can read more about avoiding burnout </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058645534\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">here</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Doing this is equally important for long and short term team health. After an extended period of dealing with the frustrating issues that come up with tons of new users, moderators and other team members may find themselves less engaged with the community and exhausted in the long term, even if they are capable of shouldering the short term stress and increased demand. This can be mitigated by moving some work to </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000178701\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">auto moderation</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> and bringing in new people for only the short term who can just dip out to take care of themselves when things settle down. Using tools like modmail snippets, and setting up text replacement rules or custom bot commands to send a template response to common questions can save a lot of time and energy. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Times of increased workload can also put on additional strain or exacerbate any existing internal issues. It is important to evaluate whether there are any important issues that you need to address before preparing for the influx of users. If your team does not think that the way you are operating is sustainable for them, that should be handled before any extra stress is added into the mix. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Advertising</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Regardless of the kind of community you’re leading, if you are expecting a huge influx of users, you may want to consider staggering your advertising efforts. If the company behind your verified game server is planning to put your invite into the game, on Twitter, Instagram, email, etc. it may be best to launch all of these announcements at different times so that there is a more manageable trickle of new users coming in. Typically, minimizing disruption is the name of the game when it comes to moderation, but there are unique instances where it can be used as a marketing tool to create a measured amount of chaos with the purpose of building a feeling of hype and excitement in the server. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you are gaining an unexpected or potentially unwelcome boost from being mentioned by a famous person or some other extraordinary situation, it may make sense to take down your regular advertising, remove your cross-linking between platforms, disable certain invites, or take any other actions to generally reduce the flow of new users. This may not help if the vast majority of your new users are coming from one source that, for example, posted a vanity invite link that you don’t want to remove and have potentially stolen by another server.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Pooling Resources/Getting Help</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Unless you have a very large team with a lot of free time, it may be necessary to reach out for help outside of your moderation team. You can add moderators or explore adding temporary helpers and junior moderators to allow some people with reduced permissions to assist in handling some of the easy to tackle and high volume issues. They can handle incoming trolls and userbots or help manage any new user onboarding process that the server employs while experienced moderators take care of trickier interpersonal situations. It will also be good to reach out to servers that have experience with similar events to ask them for context specific advice about preparing. This could be done by sharing auto moderation settings and configurations, getting bot recommendations, lending and borrowing staff members, or just sharing any particular concerns you may have. Moderation hubs can be a useful place to solicit help and advice. The same can be said for servers within your network if you have any partnerships or even servers you collaborate with in some capacity.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Auto moderation</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Auto moderation tools can greatly reduce the workload that your moderation team experiences during a stressful period for your server. It can help in a variety of ways including but not limited to:</span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Utilizing slow mode in certain busier channels </span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Adding word filters or autoresponders for specific terms related to your event</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Setting timed reminders for commonly broken rules to appear in the server</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Implement automatic punishments for certain usernames/nicknames</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Adding anti-spambot protection</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Increasing existing punishment flows (ie. switch to an automatic mute where you would have issued an automatic warning before)</span></li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Automatically filtering links or media types that can be spammy or are flagged for concerning usage </span></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000178701\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">321: Auto Moderation in Discord</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> has more information about specific auto moderation settings and configurations that can be used to help manage your space. It also includes more in depth information about moderation verification levels, which are touched on in the following section of this article.  </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is important to note that some of the scenarios being covered by this article, like being featured on the front page of Server Discovery, will cause a marked increase in the rate of new joins, but will not cause hundreds of people to join your server at once. If you are preparing for a content creator to announce a giveaway in their Discord to thousands of people watching their stream, for example, it may make sense to actually decrease your auto moderation settings to prevent anti-raid bots from being triggered by real people joining to participate in a giveaway. If you can, you should ask people who have experience with similar communities or events exactly how they modify their auto-moderation settings to most effectively manage the situation you are in. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Verification Levels and Gating</span></h3>\\n<p class=\\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If your server does not utilize moderation verification levels or verification gates, it may make sense to temporarily increase your servers security using one or both of these tools. Verification levels can help you prevent some of the lower effort trolls and self bot accounts that are targeting your server from doing any damage. You can access verification levels in the moderation settings of the server. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br><br><br><img src=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/4405267143191/mceclip0.png\\" alt=\\"mceclip0.png\\"><br><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This page includes descriptions of what each level requires for users to begin interacting. Increasing the verification level can also generally slow down the rate of new users speaking in your server. If you increase the verification level to the highest setting, users who do not have phone verified accounts may just leave the server, and it’s more likely that only high intent users will stick around and wait for the verification level to be lowered. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Verification gates can also slow down joins and put off some of the lowest intent joins that you will get. People may be unwilling to read instructions or take any additional steps to joining, and those are likely not going to be the users that you want to retain the most. You can read more about various types of verification gates in </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000177981\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">301: Implementing Verification Gates</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Gates can allow you to more easily pick off bad actors before they can disrupt community members during an already turbulent time. Low friction gates like reaction based or command based verification are probably ideal if you did not have a gate prior to preparing for this event. Other types of gating can require manual responses from moderators and can put a lot of additional time requirements and stress onto a team that is already juggling a lot. If you already have a manual verification gate, especially an interview style verification gate, it may make sense to pull in additional help to manage this system.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Permissions</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The permissions that you give new members have a large effect on how much damage bad actors can do. Limiting certain permissions such as global emoji permissions, media upload permissions, and link embed permissions can prevent users from bringing the nastiest content they could into your server. For a refresher on Discord permissions, see </span><a href=\\"https://discordmoderatoracademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000176222\\" target=\\"_self\\" rel=\\"undefined\\">201: Permissions on Discord</a><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Depending on how large the influx of new users is, and whether this is a new server or an existing one, it may make sense to restrict the ability to send messages to a select group of users or just restrict those permissions only to staff while you wait for the people joining to acclimate. This can give you time to assess how many people joined, and whether your setup is prepared to handle that kind of growth or if you need to do additional preparation before opening things up. This can also give you time to remove any new users that you already know will not be contributing members of the group (ie. people with hateful profile pictures/usernames) before they can get the chance to integrate themselves into the server. </span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Landing Pages</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If your community is seeing an influx of new users who are either new to Discord or joining for a very specific reason like event participation or large scale giveaways, it may make sense to set up a new landing page just for these users. It can get exhausting to explain the same basic information repeatedly no matter how many volunteers you have involved. Having an additional FAQ that covers information that new users will be looking for and trims out excess from your regular FAQ that doesn’t pertain to them can make their integration into the server and understanding of the information they need more straightforward and accessible for everyone involved.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Separating Users</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In the most extreme of cases, it may make sense for you to set up channels or even a separate server that is linked to your official accounts/pages on other platforms where the low intent users that are on the hype train will get deposited. This will allow you to prevent new joins from disrupting your existing community, but not require you to prevent all of the people who are excited about it from having a space related to your community to be a bit chaotic. If you choose this approach, whether you are upfront about having set your main community to private and setting up a temporary space for hype or not, you should consider explaining it throughout your typical advertising channels as time goes on. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Anything you say during the explosive growth and attention is likely to get drowned out by other information, and you may have more pressing announcements to make. This can help you retain the high intent members who joined because they only heard about you via the news about your group, but are seriously interested in becoming permanent community members while avoiding the entirety of the second server from joining the first. You can advertise your main server in the secondary server, but it\'s advisable to wait until the immediate interest has waned in the second server. At this point in time, spammers and other trolls have likely gotten bored, and the event that spurred the growth is largely in the past. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It’s important to note that the approach of making an overflow server requires a significant increase in the amount of moderator time required to manage the community. It will likely require an entirely new team to manage the chaos of the overflow server and the associated increase in attention for the uptick in discussion in the main server. This is something you should only consider in truly extraordinary circumstances. The team for the overflow server likely will not need as much training, qualification, or people skills since they will mostly be managing spam/advertising/hate speech over a short but busy period of time. They won’t likely need to talk to users about how to improve their behavior or handle tricky situations like long-term harassment or bullying, but it is still important that they be amicable as they may end up being someone\'s only interaction with your community or the subject of your community in their life. At the end of the event, the server can either be merged with your main community, or deleted; if it is deleted, members who are particularly interested in your community will likely seek your space out after losing touch.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Conclusions</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What is best for your server in times of exponential membership growth is up to you. Luckily, even if you decide not to implement something and later realize that you may need it, it can be relatively easy to implement some changes with short notice or scale back changes if you over prepared and over engineered your system. Better to be over prepared than under prepared!</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">This article should give you an idea of the main concepts to consider and keep an eye out for while preparing for and working through large increases in your servers membership. These considerations do not all need to be implemented to successfully manage rapid growth, but they should give you a good framework for the types of changes and preparations you may need depending on how extreme the growth you are expecting is. Have fun and good luck taking on this new moderation challenge!</span></p>\\n<p><br><br></p>"')

e.exports=JSON.parse('"<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In every group, eventually a conflict or dispute will arise which needs to be resolved. Sometimes this can be a small issue, but a conflict can also escalate to an argument which spirals out of control, and negatively impacts your team and your community. In this article we will look at typical situations that can occur that might lead to a conflict between members of your staff, how to de-escalate situations and work on conflict resolution, and how you can handle the demotion or removal of a moderator when no resolution can be reached. We will also cover the best practices for giving and receiving feedback from other members of the staff team.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Causes of Internal Conflicts</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There can be many causes for conflicts between your moderators, some of which occur more often than others. Some of these can easily be prevented, while others might need a more intentful thought process to stop them from escalating to a conflict. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Personality Clashes and Differences</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The main reason for conflicts to arise is a difference in personalities amongst your team. Everyone perceives, analyzes and responds differently to certain situations. While this should be a learning opportunity for everyone involved, it can lead to arguments when moderators can not get along. While emphasizing there are different approaches to the same issue, you should teach moderators to learn from each other instead of disagreements ending in a conflict. When a moderator constantly disagrees with someone else, or ends up in a personal argument, try taking them aside and let them know that they should be working on their personal issues. You can help them as an objective observer - it can be very valuable to let members of your team know that you understand their individual perspectives and are working to balance them.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Try to avoid the “Halo/Horns effect” as much as possible. This is a type of cognitive bias where your view of someone’s actions can influence how you think and feel about that person in general, both positively as well as negatively. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Poor Communication</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Misunderstandings between your moderators can lead to a conflict as well, especially when there is a different understanding of how a situation should be handled. Having transparent, consistent communication where everyone is on the same page is very important in an online setting such as Discord. Text is often perceived differently than talking over voice or even in person. Oftentimes a language barrier can lead to misinterpreting a message as well. Try to prevent misunderstandings from happening with clear communication and when misunderstandings happen, step in where possible and explain how the situation should be handled. Foster a culture where it is not only allowed but encouraged to ask for clarification on someone’s statement if you have any doubts about what their intent was. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Making jokes is beneficial for maintaining a healthy and welcoming environment and even a way to deal with the tough situations moderators may face. However, it is important to make sure that jokes don’t push the boundaries of what is appropriate and lead to perceived bullying of server members behind closed doors, or even other members of your own team. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">What is perceived to be a harmless in-joke in context could out of context seem like a malicious and unwarranted comment. When it is clear someone is not comfortable with certain jokes or feels targeted, you need to step in and clear the situation by telling moderators involved that you want a positive atmosphere where everyone feels welcomed and comfortable while clearly identifying what line was crossed so it does not happen again. That’s not to say that all close knit groups trend towards exclusionary jokes, but it is something that can happen without a team even being cognizant that it’s a problem. Hence why it’s pertinent to keep inclusivity and good faith intent in mind with situations like this. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Unfair Treatment</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">A main cause for conflicts is unfair treatment amongst members of your team. This might be because there is a lack of equal opportunities, or because there are unrealistic expectations. Make sure that everyone on your team is treated equally as everyone deserves the same treatment, regardless of your personal relationships. This also means you and other moderators should have reasonable expectations of each other. Moderators often volunteer to help out in your community, so don’t expect them to be available at all times; they might have other responsibilities as well. Any mod team’s north star should be that “real life comes first”, and to be lenient amongst themselves in the face of that. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Unclear Responsibilities</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Sometimes it is not clear what responsibilities everyone has on the team. This can lead to misunderstandings and eventually to conflicts. Make sure everyone on the team receives adequate training and information on what different roles and positions should be doing. You might want to divide different responsibilities amongst members of your team or between different roles, such as moderators and administrators. Be as transparent and clear as possible on what everyone should be doing.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Competition</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Sometimes moderators feel that they are competing against each other, especially if there are statistics or promotions available. You should always be clear that moderation is not about competition, it is about helping your community in the best way possible. Not every moderator has the same time available to help, so naturally there are going to be differences amongst your team. Moderation is not about quantity but quality - if this negatively skewed competitive atmosphere is a frequent issue, it may be worth looking at whether there are mechanisms within your community that encourage competition conflicts that could be removed or revised, such as quotas, public moderation statistics, or leaderboards.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Different Values and Standards</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Moderators usually come from all over the world and might have different values. Sometimes, these might result in a conflict. Remind your moderators that they should always respect each other\'s values, regardless of their own opinion. Moderators should be able to explain why they feel a certain way in order for others to be more understanding of the situation. When someone has values that do not align with the server’s moderation philosophy, you might need to remove them from your team.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Unresolved Underlying Issues</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is not always possible to immediately see a reason for a conflict, this might be due to unresolved underlying issues. It is very hard to know these without having a conversation with everyone involved. There can be many more causes for a dispute to arise, but it is always important to find the underlying issue which causes a conflict, only then are you able to resolve it.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Preventing Internal Conflicts</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">To minimize and prevent conflicts from happening, try as best as you can to get a comprehensive view of why and how conflicts occur in your server. It is very important to develop interpersonal relationships with all of your moderators and value their contributions to the server. Encourage moderators to take initiative in projects they are enthusiastic about, especially in collaboration with other moderators. Just as moderators set a positive example in your community, you as the leader of your moderation team should set a positive example within your team. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br><br></span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When you propose major changes to the server, listen to your team’s viewpoints before deploying and explain why a decision was made. Good communication is very important within a team, not only to prevent conflicts, but also to keep all moderators on the same page. All moderators should feel involved and informed when you are making major changes. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You can give your moderators regular feedback on how they are doing and what they can improve. Make sure moderators always feel welcome to provide feedback constructively and positively to each other and that they can always contact you or someone in charge in case a conflict does arise. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Try to discourage gossip within your team, both internal and external. When moderators start to talk about each other behind their backs, it becomes personal and can distort the relationship your moderators have and how they see themselves within the server. Instead, encourage moderators to form friendships with each other by organizing social events for your staff. During those events, you can learn about the different personalities in your team.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Last, but not least; you shouldn’t lash out over mistakes.Give feedback where it is appropriate and move on. Be quick to forgive and forget. You should always prevent belittling your moderators while also creating a culture of de-escalating situations in private.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Resolving an Internal Conflict</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are many ways to resolve conflict internally and most of these will depend on what the cause is for the conflict. A good way of resolving conflicts is using the Thomas-Kilmann model. It should be stated that conflicts are not necessarily bad and shouldn’t be avoided at all costs. When you are working in a team, it is important to be able to challenge the status quo and question each other, to keep everyone on the aligned and up to date.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In the Thomas-Kilmann model, there are two dimensions when you are choosing a course of action: assertiveness and cooperativeness. Assertiveness is the degree to which you try to satisfy your own needs where cooperativeness is the degree to which you try and satisfy the other person\'s concerns.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Based on these dimensions, there are five ways to handle a conflict:</span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br><br></span></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Avoiding:</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Ignoring the conflict</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Accommodating:</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Satisfying the other person’s concerns at your own expense</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Compromising:</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Finding an acceptable compromise that partially satisfies everyone</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Competing:</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Satisfying your own concerns at the expense of others</span>\\n</li>\\n<li style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\" aria-level=\\"1\\">\\n<strong>Collaborating:</strong><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> Finding a solution which satisfies the concerns of everyone</span>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><br><br></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">All these different ways to handle a conflict are your intention to solve them: Sometimes situations occur differently than you expect at first. Don’t jump to conclusions when you are dealing with a conflict, as the reasons for conflicts are often more complex than they first appear.  Everyone tends to resolve conflicts in a certain way, so try to balance them so you don’t end up overwhelmed or overwhelm others.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The first step is to identify the cause for the conflict. You might already know this based on previously sent messages, but sometimes you need to contact everyone involved separately and in private to determine the cause of the conflict. It is your responsibility to determine how to handle a situation. While collaborating together to resolve a conflict might look the most appealing, this will not always be possible. Try not to completely avoid a conflict: if you feel uneasy dealing with conflicts or don’t want to give moderators feedback, you might not want to be in a leading position.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you need to resolve a conflict, choose a neutral place to work it out. This might be a separate server or a private group. None of the people involved in the conflict should have power over the others, so you or someone else should act as an objective observer. If the conflict is between other moderators, you should offer guidance, but don’t offer solutions: ultimately it is up to others to resolve their conflicts, you are not taking sides.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Remember that not all conflicts require consequences. Most conflicts are sparked by the passion of your moderators who are simply in disagreement on how to deal with situations. Try to turn a conflict into a learning opportunity for everyone involved. Let them explain how they view the situation and how they would have handled it or behaved differently. Afterwards, you should be able to identify specific disagreements that you can solve. Listen to everyone involved and give everyone an equal opportunity to express themselves. Remind everyone to stay respectful at all times, even if they disagree with each other.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Giving and Receiving Feedback</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">As said before, you should discourage gossip within your team and encourage each other to give constructive feedback. It is important that everyone knows how to give and receive feedback to prevent a conflict from happening in future situations.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Giving Feedback</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When you notice a moderator that displays behavior or takes action that can be improved, you should give them feedback on how to improve this in the future. Don’t rush in giving your feedback, everyone needs time to process. When a situation becomes heated, it will not be the best time to give feedback. Remember to always give feedback in private!</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">If you are in doubt as to whether or not you should give feedback, see if you can recognize a pattern in their behavior or actions. Everyone makes mistakes and that is perfectly fine as mistakes serve as a learning opportunity and you should only give them feedback if it becomes a pattern. Additionally, it’s recommended that you ask for consent to give feedback. While this may seem a little counterintuitive to helping the moderator improve or change, blindsiding someone when they’re not ready can result in backlash rather than progress. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When you do decide to give someone feedback, don’t focus on the person who made a mistake: focus on their behavior or action instead.By making feedback personal and equating it to an issue with the individual rather than their choices, you can come off as argumentative and unconstructive and biased. Never exaggerate their behavior, be sure that you are clear and specific . When you make generalized or vague comments about someone, they will not be able to improve their behavior. Feedback should be actionable- there should be a suggestion or a change that the individual can work on as a result of the feedback. Otherwise it’s just airing your grievances, which is unproductive for all parties involved.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">The next time you see someone doing something good when you have given them feedback in the past, give them a compliment! Positive, specific feedback is especially effective in encouraging repeating said good actions. Giving each other positive feedback is just as important as giving each other constructive or corrective feedback.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Remember to always treat others as you would like to be treated yourself. It is proven that negative feedback is given mostly when people are experiencing negative emotions like hunger, anger, loneliness, and tiredness. This negative feedback method is referred to as the HALT-mode, and it is important to try to avoid situations where you are giving feedback when you find yourself in one of these states.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Receiving Feedback</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When someone is giving you feedback, it is very important to listen to what they have to say. Don’t jump to conclusions, react defensively, or disagree immediately. Take a moment to summarize the feedback as </span><em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">you</span></em><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"> understand it to make sure you have understood their feedback correctly.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You should always thank someone for giving them feedback, even if you disagree. It has to be clear you are welcoming feedback to improve. If you do not thank them, they might not give you valuable feedback in the future.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Ideally feedback is very clear and specific, in which case you can end the conversation by thanking them for their feedback and reflect back what you are going to do with the feedback in the future. Other times it might not be understandable to you and as a result, it is unclear what you should do differently in the future. In this case you should ask questions to understand their feedback better. To have a better understanding of what they want to achieve with their feedback, it is a good idea to ask the other person how they would have handled the situation or how they would have behaved. After this you should thank them and reflect back on what you are going to do with their feedback.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is okay to let someone know why you disagree with their feedback, but remember to stay respectful at all times and explain clearly why you disagree. Everyone should feel heard, even if you are not acting on their feedback.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Handling Demotions</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">There are many reasons why you might want to remove a moderator from your team, including internal conflicts you are unable to resolve. Removing or demoting a moderator is not easy to do, but can be a necessary evil. Removing someone from your team should be in the best interest of your community or team and can often be in the best interest of that person as well. Be sure to give someone an opportunity to learn from their mistakes before removing them. Give a warning first and have a conversation in private with them, following the principles of giving and receiving feedback outlined above. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">While it is not easy to deliver bad news, here are some tips to keep in mind when you do want to remove someone from your team.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Don’t delay the conversation</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Once you have made the decision to remove someone from your team, don’t hesitate and wait for the conversation to take place. When someone is causing more issues than they are solving, they will need to be removed sooner than later, but make sure that someone has had enough opportunities to fix their mistakes and resolve their issues. Please make sure you have this conversation in private, for example in direct messages or a voice call.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Keep it short and clear</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When you are talking to someone you are removing, it is important to keep your message short and clear. Tell them they are being removed from the team, why you have made this decision, and when this will take effect. Be transparent in what reasons you have for removing them, but do not go into too much detail with specific examples. This may result in a conversation where you are arguing about these examples rather than informing them of their removal.  You’re aiming for polite dismissal, not a lambasting of their character.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Stick to your decision</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Despite your message being short, clear, and transparent, you might still receive counter arguments as to why they should not be removed and to give them another chance. It is important they can express themselves, but it should be clear at all times that the decision to remove them has already been made and is not up for debate. Always listen carefully to what someone has to say and appreciate their feedback, but unless someone has substantial evidence a mistake was made, repeat your decision and make it clear that your decision is final.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Be helpful and compassionate</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Even though you are delivering bad news, you should take a supportive approach in the conversation. Remember that while it might be difficult for you to deliver bad news, it most definitely is difficult to be on the receiving end. Show empathy for them and especially when they have done a good job in the past.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"><br></span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In some cases, the moderator you’re removing may wish to receive feedback on what they can improve - giving this feedback in a constructive fashion is important, and will help them to avoid future problems. This feedback should include reflecting on the positive contributions they made to the team, helping them understand what the causes of conflict might have been while they were on your team, or simply trying to give them something positive to take forward and work on as a result of your conversation. This conversation shouldn’t reflect a reversal of your decision, but can be a useful point of reference if they want to join other servers or work on improving their skills down the line, or perhaps even re-apply to join the team in the future.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><strong>Inform your team</strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When someone has been removed from your team, make sure to inform the team of this decision. It is up to you whether or not you want to share the reason for their removal, but refrain from sharing details as these are confidential, especially when these could be potentially harmful to someone. You also want to prevent anyone, including yourself, from talking bad about them, as this sets a wrong precedent for your team. As with your decision, you should be straightforward and clear to your team, an example of this could be: “Today we have decided to remove Sarah from our team. I will not go into too much detail why this decision was made, but we believe it is the best decision for the community and the entire team.”</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In case someone was removed because of misbehavior, you might want to include that in the message, as this gives the team assurance you are not removing someone because of a personal conflict, and it shows a strong message about how you want moderators to conduct themselves.</span></p>\\n<h3><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Wrapping Up</span></h3>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">In every group, eventually a conflict or dispute will arise which needs to be resolved. There are common causes, such as personality clashes and differences, poor communication, unclear responsibilities, and harassment. To minimize and prevent conflicts from happening, try and understand as much as possible why conflicts occur in your server. It is very important to develop interpersonal relationships with all of your moderators and value their contributions to the server. Try to discourage gossip within your team. When moderators start to talk about each other behind their backs, it becomes personal and can distort the relationship your moderators have and how they see themselves within the server.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">You can resolve conflicts using the Thomas-Kilmann model. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">It is important to know conflicts are not necessarily bad and shouldn’t be avoided at all costs. When you are working in a team, it is important to be able to challenge the status quo and question each other, to keep everyone on the same page and sharp.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">When you want to give feedback to someone, talk to them in private and be clear and specific. Prevent giving feedback when you feel hungry, angry, lonely, or tired. </span><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Focus on their behavior or action instead and never exaggerate their behavior. Oppositely, when someone is giving you feedback, it is very important to listen to what they have to say and to avoid jumping to conclusions, reacting defensively, or disagreeing immediately. Take a moment to summarize the feedback to make sure you have understood their feedback correctly.</span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Sometimes you need to remove someone from your staff team. Don’t delay this conversation, keep it short and clear, and stick to your decision. When the conversation is taking place, be helpful and compassionate and do not forget to inform your team as well, but make it clear that certain things remain private for the safety and privacy of those involved. </span></p>\\n<p> </p>\\n<p><span style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\">Keeping all of those points in mind when managing a team environment will be integral to maintaining a healthy atmosphere full of various viewpoints that are united in the shared desire to keep your community safe.</span></p>"')
